      "On November 7, 2020, the Trump campaign, the [[Republican National Committee]], and the [[Arizona Republican Party]] filed a lawsuit against [[Secretary of State of Arizona|Secretary of State]] [[Katie Hobbs]] and [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] Recorder Adrian Fontes that alleged that [[overvote]]s were \"incorrectly rejected\". Overvotes occur when a voter mark more than the options allowed in a given race, and stray markings can often be processed as overvotes by tabulation machines. The machines are programmed to alert voters of the overvote, allowing them to either request a new ballot or proceed with the original one. The lawsuit argued that those who chose to file their \"original ballots are entitled to a manual inspection of their ballots later,\" and claimed that voters were urged to cast their original ballots by poll workers rather than request a new one. In total, 4,816 votes were deemed overvotes, which would be insufficient to overcome Biden's 10,457-vote advantage.  A representative for Maricopa County stated that only \"180 potential overvotes\" were involved in the lawsuit, and that it would be \"absurd\" to assume all 180 were incorrectly counted.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Polletta|first1=Maria|last2=Oxford|first2=Andrew|date=November 9, 2020|title=Republican challenge to Maricopa County election involves fewer than 200 ballots, attorneys say|work=[[Arizona Republic]]|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/11/09/arizona-election-results-maricopa-county-challenge-involves-180-ballots/6229767002/|access-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref> The Trump campaign requested that their evidence be kept secret from the public, but the judge refused to allow the secrecy.<ref name=\"Polletta\">{{cite news|last1=Polletta|first1=Maria|date=November 10, 2020|title=Judge rejects Trump team's request for secret evidence in lawsuit over Maricopa County votes|work=[[Arizona Republic]]|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/10/trump-lawsuit-maricopa-county-votes-secret-evidence-kory-langhofer-thomas-liddy/6242176002/|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref> The Trump campaign also stated that they had video footage from within a polling area; however, such footage would be illegal if taken within 75 feet of a polling area with voters present. Thomas Liddy, a lawyer representing Maricopa County, deemed the lawsuit unnecessary, as if their claims were correct, both Biden and Trump votes would be equally affected, while [[Roopali Desai]], an attorney representing the Secretary of State, argued the lawsuit attempted to \"find a problem when one does not exist\".",
