      "Born and raised in Philadelphia, IT Educator, Sick and tired of the so called city counsel & the mayors office killing our people. My first order of business would be holding Kenney, Krasner & Outlaw accountable for this lawlessness! Than bring our City BACK To Greatness! I support the Police, The Everyday Person, And Every Law Abiding Citizen! Why does a so called City Counsel not respond to this chaos here? Because they don't care for anything......Other than you voting for them.",
