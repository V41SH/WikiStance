      "==Background==",
      "Biden narrowly won the state of Georgia during the [[2020 US presidential election]], which many considered to be a \"swing state\", with a very small margin of votes. Nevertheless, the [[Trump campaign]] continued to claim disputed accounts of voter fraud, the majority of which were largely dismissed. Trump's legal campaigns of voter fraud were overwhelmingly refuted in legal claims, although Trump has repeatedly refused to accept the election results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html|title=Distribution of Electoral Votes|website=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> Audits were made and hand recounts were asked, all of which had ultimately concluded there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would considerably change the results.",
      "",
      "==Taped Conversation==",
      "During the phonecall, Donald Trump mantained incorrectly that he had won the State of Georgia for his re-election, continuing to insist that the election results were wrong. Afterwards, Trump reportedly started to begin threats to Raffensperger, after it became clear that his attempts to persuation would not work. In a certain passage of the tape, he claimed that what he needed was \"11.780\" votes, and that Raffensperger should \"reevaluate\" the election's results, claiming a myriad of different conspiracy theories regarding voting in the state. Raffensperger, in response, answered that the election results in that state were correct and legitimate, and that Trump \"had got his data wrong.\"<ref>{{citeweb|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html|title = ‘I just want to find 11,780 votes’: In extraordinary hour-long call, Trump pressures Georgia secretary of state to recalculate the vote in his favor}}</ref> During his attempts to pressure [[Raffensperger]] into changing the election results, at some point Trump claimed \"I just want to find 11,780\" votes in order to turn the state of Georgia. During different points of the conversation Trump had asked for his support for the Republican Party in an alleged partisan manner, and at other points threatened him with legal action if Raffensperger would not cooperate with the president."
