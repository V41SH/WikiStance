      "On the morning of May 19th, 2008,<ref>rb.gy/2oui9b</ref> Sliwa started a short-lived feud with morning radio hosts [[Opie and Anthony]] despite an earlier encounter where both parties were respectful to each other. Sliwa was angered over the firing of reporter Arthur Chi'en, who was fired for cursing while live on television after Opie and Anthony fans were teasing him as part of the \"O&A Assault on the Media\" campaign. The hosts mocked his mannerisms, extreme conservatism, on-air personality, attempts to spread misinformation, colloquialisms, the fact Sliwa was forced to give up the majority of his time slot to [[Don Imus]], constant recollections of his kidnapping, and frequent references to the Italian Mafia.",
      "",
      "The hosts attempted to contact Sliwa to defend themselves, however the representative on the phone informed their producer that he was doing an interview with a college radio station. Upon calling the same college radio station, they were informed that Sliwa was not scheduled to be interviewed that day. Sliwa's call screener was then questioned why they chose to give them false information, to which it was implied Sliwa was avoiding any sort of on-air confrontation despite his insults and derogatory comments. Sliwa proceeded to inform his audience that the Opie and Anthony producer was \"stalking\" him and gave out the producer's cellular phone number live on air in an attempt to retaliate."
