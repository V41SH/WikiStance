      "Congresswoman Fischbach, over the dates of January 6th and 7th, 2021, and in her first substantive act as a Congresswoman, voted in support of a policy to disenfranchise voters by disallowing millions of legitimately cast election ballots.  In the opinion of many in her district and state, her vote permanently tarred her as a conspirator in sedition against her own country."

      "On March 18, 2021, during the hearing on violence and terror against Asians and Asian-Americans, Fischbach took the position that affirmative action is racism on par with mass murder. While the representative condemned affirmative action in no uncertain terms, she was unable to condemn the violence or derogatory language used by her fellow party members against Asians and Asian Americans."
