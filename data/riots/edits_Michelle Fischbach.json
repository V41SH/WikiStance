      "Congresswoman Fischbach, over the dates of January 6th and 7th, 2021, and in her first substantive act as a Congresswoman, voted in support of a policy to disenfranchise voters by disallowing millions of legitimately cast election ballots.  In the opinion of many in her district and state, her vote permanently tarred her as a conspirator in sedition against her own country."

      "In 2020, Michelle Fischbach, one of only two MN representatives to do so, objected to the certification of electoral votes in the matter of President-elect Joe Biden. In doing so, proved herself to be unfit to serve Minnesotans and the United States."
