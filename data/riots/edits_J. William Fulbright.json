      "After joining the Senate, Fulbright expressed support for [[Europeanism]] and the formation of [[European Union|a federal European union]]. He envisioned the Cold War as a struggle between nations—the United States and [[Soviet Empire|imperialist Russia]]—rather than ideologies. He therefore dismissed Asia as a peripheral theater of the conflict, focusing on [[containment]] of [[Formation of the Eastern Bloc|Soviet expansion into Central and Eastern Europe]]. He also stressed the possibility of [[nuclear annihilation]], preferring political solutions to Soviet aggression over military solutions. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], his position moderated further to one of [[détente]].",

      "His political stances and powerful position as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] made him one of the most visible critics of American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], though he was a sponsor of and leading advocate for the [[Gulf of Tonkin resolution]]. In 1971, he chaired [[Fulbright Hearings|high-profile hearings investigating the conduct and progress of the war]], which may have influenced the eventual American withdrawal."
