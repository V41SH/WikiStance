      "In the late-1960s, when Harris was a [[toddler]], she was taken to a [[Civil rights movement|civil rights march]] in Oakland California. Being so young, she marched with her parents and uncle in a [[Baby_transport#Strollers|stroller]]. During the course of the march Kamala fell from the stroller and became separated from the adults. She was not missed for a few minutes because her parents were swept up in the excitement of the march. After a few minutes, her parents noticed she was missing and retrace their steps to find the child. When found Kamala was visibly upset and her mother asked, \"Baby, what do you want? What do you need?’ And I just looked at her and I said, ‘Fweedom.’”<ref>{{cite news |last=Ford |first=Ashley C. |url=https://www.elle.com/culture/a34225242/kamala-harris-interview/ |title=Kamala Harris Is Our New Vice President-Elect |work=Elle (magazine) |date=2019-10-06 |accessdate=2021-01-05 }}</ref>"
