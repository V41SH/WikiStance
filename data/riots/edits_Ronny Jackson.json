      "Congressman Jackson's tenure was unusually short, as he decided to resign his position and also to renounce his commission in the U.S. Navy in order to join the fight to overturn the democratic elections of 2020, just as his heroes, the leaders of the Confederacy did more than 100 years ago when they chose to support armed insurrection against the United States."
