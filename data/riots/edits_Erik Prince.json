      "Blackwater came under increasing criticism after the [[Nisour Square massacre]] in September 2007, in which Blackwater employees opened fire in a crowded square in Baghdad, killing 17 Iraqi civilians and seriously wounding 20 more. Three guards were convicted in October 2014 of 14 manslaughter charges, and another of murder, in a U.S. court in 2019.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/us-jury-convicts-blackwater-security-guards-iraq U.S. Jury convicts Blackwater guards in 2007 killings of Iraqi civilians], [[The Guardian]].

      "The criticism continued after president [[Barack Obama]] took office in 2009. Prince said he believes that much of this criticism stems from politics. \"I put myself and my company at the CIA's disposal for some very risky missions,\" Prince told ''Vanity Fair'' for its January 2010 issue. \"But when it became politically expedient to do so, someone threw me under the bus.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite magazine|last=Ciralsky |first=Adam |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/01/blackwater-201001 |title=January 2010: Adam Ciralsky on Blackwater |magazine=Vanity Fair |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>"
