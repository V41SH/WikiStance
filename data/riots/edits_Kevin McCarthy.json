      "On January 6, 2021, McCarthy and other Republican elected officials tried to overturn the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the President and Vice President of the United States. Many Republican politicians incited insurrection against the United States Government in order to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Elections in which Donald Trump lost. The United States Capitol was attacked and ransacked by a mob incited by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and Ken Paxton among others. There were calls for his expulsion from the U.S. Congress for his seditious acts."
