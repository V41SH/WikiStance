In fact, there was a strange impression given throughout the event that attendees believe Christianity is, in some sense, [[consubstantial]] with American nationalism. It was as if a new and improved Holy Trinity of “Father, Son, and [[Uncle Sam]]” had taken the place of the old and outmoded [[Nicene Creed|Nicene version]]. When [[Eric Metaxas]], the partisan radio host and emcee for the event, first stepped on stage, he wasn’t greeted with psalm-singing or with hymns of praise to the Holy Redeemer, but with chants of “USA!

      "Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] thinks that emotional themes in Trump's rhetoric are fundamental, writing that his \"speeches—evoking dominance, bravado, clarity, national pride, and personal uplift—inspire an emotional transformation,\" deeply resonating with their \"emotional self-interest\". Hoschild's perspective is that Trump is best understood as an \"emotions candidate\", arguing that comprehending the emotional self-interests of voters explains the paradox of the success of such politicians raised by [[Thomas Frank]]'s book ''[[What's the Matter with Kansas? (book)|What's the Matter with Kansas?]]'', an anomaly which motivated her five year immersive research into the emotional dynamics of the [[Tea Party movement]] which she believes has mutated into Trumpism.{{sfn|Hochschild|2016|pp=8, 14, 223}}{{sfn|Thompson|2020}} The book resulting from her research, ''[[Strangers in Their Own Land]]'', was named one of the \"6{{nbs}}books to understand Trump's Win\" by the New York Times.{{sfn|NYTimes11_09|2016}} Hochschild claims it is wrong for progressives to assume that well educated individuals have mainly been persuaded by political rhetoric to vote against their rational self interest through appeals to the \"bad angels\" of their nature:{{notetag|A reference to a metaphor found at the close of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]]. Cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] explains the impact of these appeals in his book [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]].}} their greed, selfishness, racial intolerance, [[homophobia]], and desire to get out of paying taxes that go to the unfortunate.\" She grants that the appeal to bad angels are made by Trump, but that it \"obscures another—to the right wing's good angels—their patience in waiting in line in scary economic times, their capacity for loyalty, sacrifice, and endurance\", qualities she describes as a part of a motivating narrative she calls their \"deep story\", a [[social contract]] narrative that appears to be widely shared in other countries as well.{{sfn|Hochschild|2016|pp=230, 234}} She thinks Trump's rhetoric achieves group cohesiveness among his followers by exploiting a crowd phenomenon [[Emile Durkheim]] called \"[[collective effervescence]]\", \"a state of emotional excitation felt by those who join with others they take to be fellow members of a moral or biological tribe{{nbs}}... to affirm their unity and, united, they feel secure and respected.\"{{sfn|Hochschild|2016|p=223}}",
      "This three-part pattern was first identified in 1932 by [[Roger Money-Kyrle]] and later published in his ''Psychology of Propaganda''.{{sfn|Money-Kyrle|2015|pp=166–168}} A constant barrage of sensationalistic rhetoric serves to rivet media attention while achieving multiple political objectives, not the least of which is that it serves to obscure actions such as profound [[neoliberal]] [[deregulation]]. One study gives the example that significant environmental deregulation occurred, but escaped much media attention, during the first year of the Trump administration due to its concurrent use of spectacular racist rhetoric. According to the authors, this served political objectives of dehumanizing its targets, eroding democratic norms, and consolidating power by emotionally connecting with and inflaming resentments among the base of followers, but most importantly it served to distract media attention from deregulatory [[Public policy|policymaking]] by igniting intense media coverage of the distractions, precisely due to their radically transgressive nature.{{sfn|Pulido|Bruno|Faiver-Serna|Galentine|2019}}",

People with good math skills could interpret the data correctly but once politics was introduced, with data demonstrating whether gun control decreased or increased crime, the same participants, whether liberal or conservative, who were good at math, misinterpreted the results to conform to their political leanings. This study disconfirms the \"science comprehension thesis\" and supports the \"identity-protective cognition thesis\" explanations for inability to agree on shared facts having to do with politicized public policy.{{sfn|Kahan|Peters|Dawson|Slovic|2017}}}} While such media-enabled departures from shared, fact-based reality dates at least as far back as 1439 with the appearance of the [[Gutenberg press]],{{sfn|McIntyre|2018|p=97}} what is new about social media is the personal bond created through direct and instantaneous communications from the leader, and the constant opportunity to repeat the messages and participate in the group identity signaling behavior. Prior to 2015, Trump already had firmly established this kind of parasocial bond with a substantial base of followers due to his repeated television and media appearances.{{sfn|Gabriel|Paravati|Green|Flomsbee|2018}} For those sharing political views similar to his, Trump's use of Twitter to share his conspiratorial views caused those emotional bonds to intensify, causing his supporters to feel a deepened empathetic bond as with a friend—sharing his anger, sharing his moral outrage, taking pride in his successes, sharing in his denial of failures and his oftentimes conspiratorial views.{{sfn|Paravati|Naidu|Gabriel|Wiedemann|2019}}",
      "Given their effectiveness as an emotional tool, Brooks thinks such sharing of conspiracy theories has become the most powerful community bonding mechanism of the 21st century.{{sfn|Brooks|2020}} Conspiracy theories usually have a strong political component{{sfn|Imhoff|Lamberty|2018|p=6}} and books such as Hofstadter's ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'' describe the political efficacy of these alternate takes on reality. Some attribute Trump's political success to making such narratives a regular staple of Trumpist rhetoric, such as the purported rigging of the 2016 election to defeat Trump, that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, that Obama was not born in the United States, multiple conspiracy theories about the Clintons, that vaccines cause autism and so on.{{sfn|van Prooijen|2018|p=65}} One of the most popular though disproven and discredited conspiracy theories is [[Qanon]], which asserts that top Democrats run an elite child sex-trafficking ring and President Trump is making efforts to dismantle it. An October 2020 [[Yahoo]]-[[YouGov]] poll showed that these Qanon claims are mainstream, not fringe beliefs among Trump supporters, with both elements of the theory said to be true by fully half of Trump supporters polled.{{sfn|Bote|2020}}{{sfn|Bump|2020}}"
