He previously served as the eighth [[United States Secretary of State]] from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and as a member of the [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] representing [[Massachusetts]]. He was the eldest son of [[John Adams]], who served as the second US president from 1797 to 1801, and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Abigail Adams]]. Initially a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].",

After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in [[Boston]]. In 1794, President [[George Washington]] appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when [[Thomas Jefferson]] took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, Adams was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to [[Russia]] by President [[James Madison]], a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the [[War of 1812]]. In 1817, newly elected president [[James Monroe]] selected Adams as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]], which provided for the American acquisition of [[Florida]]. He also helped formulate the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which became a key tenet of [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]].",
      "",
      "The [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] was contested by Adams, [[Andrew Jackson]], [[William H. Crawford]], and [[Henry Clay]], all of whom were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. As no candidate won a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]] to determine the president, and Adams won that contingent election with the support of Clay. As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included [[Internal improvements|federally funded infrastructure projects]], the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of [[Latin America]], but many of his initiatives were defeated in Congress. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party polarized into two major camps: one group, known as the [[National Republican Party]], supported President Adams, while the other group, known as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was led by Andrew Jackson. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson decisively defeated Adams in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]], the second president (after his father) to fail re-election.",
      "",
      "Rather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 to his death in 1848. He remains the only ex-president to be elected to the chamber (although [[John Tyler]] was elected a [[Confederate Congress|Confederate representative]], dying before seated). Narrowly failing attempts at [[Governor of Massachusetts]] and re-election to the Senate, Adams joined the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] in the early 1830s before becoming a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and of the Southern leaders who he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the [[annexation of Texas]] and the [[Mexican–American War]], which he saw as a war to extend slavery and [[Slave Power|its political grip on Congress]]. He also led the repeal of the \"[[gag rule]]\", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery]]. Historians generally concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history; they [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|typically rank]] him as an average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress."
