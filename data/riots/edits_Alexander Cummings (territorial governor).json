      "Cummings had a bitter feud with the pro-state Secretary of the Colorado Territory, [[Samuel Hitt Elbert]].  Upon his arrival in Colorado, Cummings was not satisfied with the quality and location of the territorial offices and accused Elbert of deliberatively selecting them to inconvenience him and the territorial government.  When Cummings moved the office, he took the Great Seal of the Territory which was used to affix public documents.  Elbert demanded the return of the seal since it was his official duty to use the seal.  The feud escalated to Cummings' superior, U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] and prompted the resignation of Elbert.{{sfn|Hanchett|1957|pp=87-89}}",
