      "The '''2018 West Virginia Senate elections''' were held on November 6, 2018, as part of the biennial United States elections. Seventeen of West Virginia's 34 state senators were up for election. [[West Virginia Senate]] districts each have two elected representatives. State senators serve staggered four-year terms in West Virginia, with one senator from each district up in even-numbered years corresponding to presidential election years (most recently held in 2016), and the other up in even-numbered years corresponding to presidential midterm years.",
      "",
      "Primary elections in the state were held on May 8. After the previous 2016 state elections, Republicans held a majority in the Senate, holding 22 seats to the Democrats' 12. The Republican Party had long been the minority party in the Mountain State, but the decline of the strength of coal worker unions, the Democratic Party's increasing focus on environmentalism, the unpopularity of President [[Barack Obama]], and the increasing social conservatism of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] have helped the GOP solidify power in the state rapidly since 2000.",
      "",
      "Despite the high popularity of President [[Donald Trump]] within the state and his 42-point margin of victory there in [[2016 United States presidential election in West Virginia|2016]], the Democrats gained two seats in the West Virginia Senate in 2018. This can be attributed to the competitive U.S. Senate race at the top of the ticket (which was won by incumbent Democrat [[Joe Manchin]]), the increasing insulation of the [[West Virginia Democratic Party]] from the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (particularly on social issues, such as [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]), and a strong year for the Democratic Party nationally, in which they gained control of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].",
      "",
      "Following the state's 2018 Senate elections, Republicans maintained control of the Senate with 20 seats to the Democrats' 14.",
