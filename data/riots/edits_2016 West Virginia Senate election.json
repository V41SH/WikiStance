The Republican Party had long been the minority party in the Mountain State, but the decline of the strength of coal worker unions, the Democratic Party's increasing focus on environmentalism, the unpopularity of President [[Barack Obama]], and the increasing social conservatism of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] have helped the GOP solidify power in the state rapidly since 2000.",

This can be attributed to the competitive U.S. Senate race at the top of the ticket (which was won by incumbent Democrat [[Joe Manchin]]), the increasing insulation of the [[West Virginia Democratic Party]] from the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (particularly on social issues, such as [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]), and a strong year for the Democratic Party nationally, in which they gained control of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].",
