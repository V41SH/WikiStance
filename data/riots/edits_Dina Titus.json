      "Democrats were heavily targeting [[Nevada's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]] Republican incumbent [[Jon Porter]]. Their top candidate was [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] prosecutor Robert Daskas, but Daskas dropped out in April for family reasons. Democrats then recruited Titus, who had won the district in her unsuccessful 2006 run for governor. Titus defeated Porter in November, 47% to 42%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district. She was a major beneficiary of the overall anti-Bush sentiment in the Las Vegas area. She was elected Regional Whip in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Usufzy|first=Pashtana|title=Titus appointed regional whip|url=http://unlvrebelyell.com/2008/12/01/titus-appointed-regional-whip|access-date=October 8, 2011|newspaper=Rebel Yell|date=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118234441/http://unlvrebelyell.com/2008/12/01/titus-appointed-regional-whip/|archive-date=November 18, 2011}}</ref>",

      "On October 31, 2011, Titus entered the Democratic primary for {{ushr|Nevada|1}}, where her home had been placed by redistricting. The incumbent, fellow Democrat [[Shelley Berkley]], gave up the seat to run for the [[United States Senate]]. While the 3rd is considered a swing district, the 1st is far and away the safest Democratic seat in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/titus-to-announce-run-for-1st-district-seat-132958858.html|title=Titus to announce new bid for Congress|date=October 31, 2011|access-date=November 2, 2011|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|first=Laura|last=Myers}}</ref> She initially faced a challenge from State Senator [[Ruben Kihuen]] in the primary.
