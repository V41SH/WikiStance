He is running on a progressive platform of Medicare For All, a Green New Deal, and robust investments in public education. He's mounting an insurgent progressive campaign against incumbent Eliot Engel, whom he's criticized for his hawkish foreign policy views and for being out of touch with the 16th district. During the pandemic, Engel has spent much of his time in Maryland rather than with his district's constituents, and was recently caught on a hot mic admitting that \"if he didn't have a primary, [he] wouldn't care\" about speaking at a press conference. Bowman has been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Katie Porter, AOC, Ayanna Pressley, and the New York Times, and has the support of groups like MoveOn and the Sunrise Movement.|author=[[Robert Reich]]|date=June 22, 2020|work=[[Facebook]]|access-date=June 22, 2020}}</ref>",
