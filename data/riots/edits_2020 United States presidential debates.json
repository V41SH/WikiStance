      "The moderators are completely unbiased, non-partisan Democrats who will cut the microphone of any orange haired candidate while heâ€™s making a good point.

The moderator is also equipped with a fire hose to be used on any candidate from either party named Donald if he should refuse to stop talking about the millions of dollars the other candidate took in bribes from foreign dictators."
