      "As his views on segregation changed, he found himself progressively more and more isolated in the powerful Pro-segregation Democrat party.  Finding support for his enlightened beliefs of anti-segregation in the Republican party, Thurmond was quoted as saying, \"I feel a strong brotherhood for all that is good and clearly what is right, with my republican brethren.\"  He would often clash with now President Biden, over his (Bidens') anti-segregation beliefs and often racist rhetoric when referring to the African American community.  During one of Senator Biden's speech's, he used the term-racial jungle to referring to African American children who were to be bussed into predominately white schools in an effort to enforce integration. Thurmond stated he felt ill and was sickened that in that day and age someone believed as then Senator Biden did.  Thurmond also fought viciously against the Democrats \"Jim Crow\" laws, the Democrats answer to inclusion of African Americans. Thurmond, a military man, was not afraid of a fight, understood that he would be made to answer for his legacy of racial oppression while serving as in the Democrat party, and that that fight may never end."
