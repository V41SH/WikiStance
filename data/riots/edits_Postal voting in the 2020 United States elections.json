      "This article is totally propagandist and without any objectivity. Is totally far from the needed level of objectivity that have thousands serious articles of Wikipedia, a single person insist in edit this article taking of any part that try to add some information. The readers can find in this article also a indication to 'Russian interference' (MSNBC docet) and this qualify the low level of this article without any other argument. The forceful essay to maintain an article as this one in Wikipedia show how in this time in USA, unfortunately there is a faction that is completely blind or totally unrespectful to the opinions of tens of millions of US Citizens but worse the same faction is totally insensible to the seriously negative social and economical condition of those citizens. To be precise the subject that continue to try to enforce the misinformation of this article say that he is from the republic of NZRE https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Republic_of_NZRE and have only 17 years (probably all spent looking ad MSNBC), Dear citinzen of the quasi dictatorship of Google-California I write from Europe where there is still a minimum amount of freedom and democracy, If I was living in USA now (2021) probably I will be afraid to write this comments, but I think that the tens of millions of oppressed people of US in a short time will restore their democracy and their important place in the world."
