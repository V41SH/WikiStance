      "The 926 delegates to the [[1900 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]], which met in [[Philadelphia]] on June 19–21, re-nominated William McKinley by acclamation. [[Thomas C. Platt]], the \"boss\" of the New York State Republican Party, did not like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], New York's popular governor, even though he was a fellow Republican. Roosevelt's efforts to reform New York politics – including Republican politics – led Platt and other state Republican leaders to pressure President McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his new vice- presidential candidate, thus filling the spot left open when Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died in 1899. By electing Roosevelt vice president, Platt would remove Roosevelt from New York state politics. Although Roosevelt was reluctant to accept the nomination for vice president, which he regarded as a relatively trivial and powerless office, his great popularity among most Republican delegates led McKinley to pick him as his new running mate. Quite unexpectedly, Roosevelt would be elevated to the presidency in September 1901, when McKinley was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]."

      "After Admiral George Dewey's return from the Spanish–American War, many suggested that he run for president on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket. Dewey, however, had already angered some [[Protestantism|Protestants]] by marrying the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Mildred McLean Hazen (the widow of General [[William Babcock Hazen]] and daughter of [[Washington McLean]], owner of ''[[The Washington Post]]'') in November 1899 and giving her the house that the nation had given him following the war.<ref>[http://elections.harpweek.com/1900/cartoon-1900-Medium.asp?UniqueID=7&Year=1900 HarpWeek | Elections | 1900 Medium Cartoons<!-- bot-generated title -->] at elections.harpweek.com</ref> His candidacy was also almost immediately plagued by a number of public relations gaffes. Newspapers started attacking him as naïve after he was quoted as saying the job of president would be easy, since the chief executive was merely following orders in executing the laws enacted by Congress, and that he would \"execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders of my superiors.\" Shortly thereafter, he admitted never having voted in a presidential election before, mentioning that the only man he ever would have voted for, had he voted, would have been [[Grover Cleveland]]. He drew even more criticism when he offhandedly (and prophetically) told a newspaper reporter that, \"Our next war will be with Germany.\"<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/convention/diary/diaryprint.html Convention Diary: NRO Total Convention<!-- bot-generated title -->] at nationalreview.com</ref>",
