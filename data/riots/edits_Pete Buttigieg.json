      "In January 2019, Buttigieg launched the South Bend Home Repair initiative. This expanded the existing South Bend Home Repair Pilot, which helps make available funds to assist residents with home repairs, through the use of $600,000 in city funding (double what the city had earlier pledged to the program) and $300,000 in [[block grants]].<ref name=jan152019>{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Caleb |title=South Bend officials highlight home repair programs |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-officials-highlight-home-repair-programs/article_f6cc225b-d89e-5bb0-9a17-7f6bff70255f.html |newspaper=South Bend Tribune |access-date=November 16, 2019 |date=January 15, 2019}}</ref> He also created two new programs. The first of these is the South Bend Green Corps, which makes funds available to lower-income homeowners for such uses as energy-saving measures and basic weatherization, the installation of [[Smoke detector|smoke]] and [[Carbon monoxide detector|carbon monoxide]] detectors, lead tests, and energy bill review. It also provides education on reducing energy bills.<ref name=jan152019/> The South Bend Green Corps was funded with $290,000 from the city and $150,000 from [[AmeriCorps]].<ref name=jan152019/> The second program is Love Your Block, which assists citizen groups and local nonprofits in revitalizing neighborhoods, and which was funded with $25,000 from the city and $25,000 from the nonprofit Cities of Service.<ref name=jan152019/>"
