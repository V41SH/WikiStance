      "In the summer of 1864, Rutherford B. Hayes was under suspicion of the killing of 10 innocent civilians of Tomato Town, including one armed suspect that was not related to the mass shooting. It is quoted in the later published news article headed \"Fortnite Addict Shoots Ten Dead\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fortnite â€“ A Free-to-Play Battle Royale Game and More|url=https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home|access-date=2021-03-15|website=Epic Games' Fortnite|language=en-US}}</ref> that \"The ten civilians that were shot down by B. Hayes included that of a local essential oils shop. Though the reason of the crime is not specified at this time, there is much speculation that he was taking on Grant's habits\". With the surplus of speculation on Rutherford B. Hayes, he pulled a tactic now known as the \"Virgin Move\", which consists of gaining a Victory Royale. He achieved this by taking on the rest of the South and gaining the Victory Royale for the Union Troops. With this new title, it made Rutherford B. Hayes a household name for many Northern families. There are many stories about Northern civilians watching \"streams\" of Hayes, but this cannot be proved based on lack of evidence."
