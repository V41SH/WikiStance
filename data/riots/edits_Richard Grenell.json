      "'''Julian Assange is an award-winning journalist currently being tortured for exposing war crimes. Trump, acting on behalf of the conniving will of this soulless neocon, had Julian dragged out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. While judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled against extradition to the US, he remains imprisoned in Belmarsh prison for no true reason as the US appeals the decision to not extradite him. He is being charged under the Espionage act for the act of journalism, and his case presents a great threat to the free press. Without a mass movement to Free Assange, journalism will effectively be buried forever.'''"
