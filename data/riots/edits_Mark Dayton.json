      "==Barbarian King of Minnesota==",
      "When Minnesota got too cold, it got taken over by orcs and dimensionally transported to a fantasy world where he was possessed by nanomachines and flexed on anyone who opposed him. This utter dominance held through pure musculoskeletal force is by far King Mark Dayton's greatest accomplishment. His feats are so legendary, and his might so fearsome, that he was often spoken of in hushed whispers- hence, no one is able to hear those legends clearly and none of them are written down."
