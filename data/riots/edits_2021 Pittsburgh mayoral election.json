Peduto received the endorsements of some other Democratic leaders, including County Executive [[Rich Fitzgerald]], U.S. Representative [[Mike Doyle]], and State Senate minority leader [[Jay Costa]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Tom |title=Allegheny County Dems endorse Ed Gainey in Pittsburgh mayoral race |url=https://triblive.com/local/allegheny-county-dems-endorse-ed-gainey-in-pittsburgh-mayoral-race/ |access-date=10 March 2021 |agency=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review}}</ref>"
