      "[[Notoriouz]] released a public statement via Twitter denouncing President Donald Trump's usage of his hit song \"Thrilled - Edit\" by [[Notoriouz]] in public promotional material. [[Notoriouz]] is quoted as saying \"Yeah I just really think Donny boy is kind of a creep. Bad hair lookin ass stanky doodoo breath no hand soap gotta go to the store without washing his hands to buy more soap type beat type of dude. Really harshing the vibe, you know? Thrilled - Edit is a great song and I think it deserves a more reputable platform.\""
