      "* 1918 was the first time women voted for governor of New York, and Alfred E. Smith was the first governor elected with more than 1 million votes. But, given the much-expanded electorate, his historic total still represented only a plurality of votes.",
      "* For comparison, in the [[New York gubernatorial election of 1916|New York Gubernatorial Election of 1916]], Charles S. Whitman (whom Smith defeated in 1918) had won a 52.63% majority with 850,020 votes.",
      "* The total ballots cast for governor in 1918 was 2,192,970. Besides the votes for the above candidates, there were 43,630 [[blank vote]]s; 16,892 [[spoilt vote]]s; and 530 scattering votes.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/12/31/97057956.pdf \"Election result\"], ''The New York Times,'' 31 December 1918</ref>",
      "* The Governor's term was extended to four years in 1938, Article IV, New York Constitution.",

      "Note: This was the last time the running mate of the elected governor was defeated, Democrat Smith having Republican Lowman as lieutenant for the duration of this term."
