      "Donald Trump will go down as The Greatest President in History. The 2020 election was rigged in favor of Biden and Kamala. The day he announced he was running as a republican nominee, there was a price on his head. The untrue and unwarranted harassment went on relentlessly for 4 years. They would rather see America crash and burn before they let him have a successful page in history. They can not stop Gods will."
