      "Braun opposes the [[Affordable Care Act]], [[same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Braun is a self-described conservationist who has pressured the Republican Party to take climate change more seriously; however, he also supported U.S. withdrawal from the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Accords]]. During Trump's presidency, he supported Trump's [[Trump tariffs|trade and tariff policies]] after having previously been a free trade advocate. Braun voted to acquit Trump in the impeachment trial related to the [[Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal|Trump-Ukraine scandal]]. After Joe Biden won the 2020 election and Trump refused to concede while making false claims of fraud, Braun defended Trump's attempt to overturn the election results and subvert the democratic process."
