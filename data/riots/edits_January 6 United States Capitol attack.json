      "===Federal Lawsuit Accusing Trump and Giuliani of Inciting Capitol Riot===",
      "On 16 February 2021, Trump was sued by the nation's oldest civil rights organization, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] on behalf of the House Homeland Security chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi for conspiring to incite the violent assault at the Capitol.<ref>[https://naacp.org/latest/naacp-files-federal-lawsuit-accusing-trump-and-giuliani-of-inciting-u-s-capitol-riot NAACP Files Federal Lawsuit Accusing Trump and Giuliani of Inciting U.S. Capitol Riot]</ref> Included in the federal lawsuit as defendants are Trump's former personal lawyer Giuliani, and the two [[neo-fascist]], [[far-right]] organizations [[Proud Boys]] and [[Oath Keepers]]. The lawsuit alleges that, by preventing - \"by the use of force, intimidation, and threat\" - the Congress from carrying out its constitutional duties, Trump, Giuliani and the [[hate group]]s directly violated the 1871 [[Ku Klux Klan Act]]. The law was first passed following the Civil War to combat the [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and allow African Americans to take action against hate groups who use “force, intimidation, or threat” to prevent leaders from doing the duties of their office.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/us/politics/naacp-sues-trump-giuliani-proud-boys-capitol.html N.A.A.C.P.
