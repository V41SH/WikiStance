      "{{cquote|It has become apparent that President Trump is a continuing threat to our democracy and danger to our national security.  He abused the power of his office for personal and political gain at the expense of our national security; he conditioned official acts{{emdash}}millions in military aid and a White House meeting{{emdash}}for his personal, political gain; and he attempted to cheat our democracy and corrupt our elections. And so today, I will vote in favor of the two articles of impeachment against President Trump. No one is above the law. Not even the President.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://horsford.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-steven-horsford-votes-hold-president-accountable-and-uphold-our|title=Congressman Steven Horsford Votes to Hold the President Accountable and Uphold Our Constitution|date=December 18, 2019|website=Representative Steven Horsford}}</ref>}}"
