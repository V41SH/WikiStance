What is the particular notability of the companies he heads? Neither of them have articles about them, so their significance needs to be established in this article, if they are indeed all that significant.",

There are no articles for instance, about either of the men who have been wed to [[Luci Baines Johnson]]. Both [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)|Barbara Pierce Bush]]'s and [[Jenna Bush Hager]]'s husbands lack an article. Only two of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s many children-in-law  have articles. ([[David Sills]] has their own article because he was a politician and judge, and [[Paul Grilley]] because he was notable in the field of [[yoga]]). Etc., etc."
