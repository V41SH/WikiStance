      "The following is edited by a Naturalized Citizen of the USA: Knowing what I know about the Republican party since Oct 1979 when I came to this country, it is quite obvious that the Republicans have been quite clever in denying voting rights of non-whites (perhaps long before Nixon came on the scene).  Besides the big corporations have been taking over the media and carrying on propaganda.  The white-ruling class has been unchristian and this helped by the so-called religious-right etc...  Jimmy Carter lost to the clownish actor Ronald Regan, because the latter played treasonous games with Iran (in getting the hostages freed the day Mr. Regan got inagurated).  Nixon himself had surreptiously stopped Peace Treaty with Vietnam, thereby winning his election against LBJ.  Through and through Republicans have been dishonest.  Abraham Lincoln, if he were to be alive today, he would speak against the Republican Party.  Even Jesus would get called a communist etc by the dishonest Republicans.  We all should continue to beg the Lord of All to save America and Americans from the heartless unscrupulous Republicans!  May they all go to their graves in shame after living on our planet for a very long long time!"
