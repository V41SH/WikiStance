      "Adelson said that because of his upbringing in an immigrant family in an underprivileged neighborhood of Boston, \"it went without saying that we were Democrats\". He attributed his family's loyalty to their belief that the Democratic Party of the 1930s and 1940s shared their commitment to charity, self-reliance, and accountability, as well as support for Jewish causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/i-didnt-leave-democrats-they-left-me/news-story/3e7371768428a9d404e651df70e72ab8|title=I didn't leave Democrats, they left me|first=Sheldon G.|last=Adelson|date=November 7, 2012|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|access-date=October 14, 2017|archive-date=October 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027150924/https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fi-didnt-leave-democrats-they-left-me%2Fnews-story%2F3e7371768428a9d404e651df70e72ab8&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium&nk=6d40697960b4c8b4f2d8466ae13f64cc-1603811364|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2012 ''Wall Street Journal'' op-ed titled \"I Didn't Leave the Democrats. They Left me\", Adelson specified three reasons why he switched political parties to the Republicans. First, he cited foreign policy, pointing to a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll that suggests Republicans are more supportive of Israel than Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/poll-78-of-republicans-support-israel-versus-53-of-democrats/0/?print|title=Poll: 78% of Republicans Support Israel versus 53% of Democrats|newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]|date=March 18, 2012|access-date=October 10, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014180512/http://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/poll-78-of-republicans-support-israel-versus-53-of-democrats/0/?print|archive-date=October 14, 2013}}</ref> Second, he cited statistics that suggest Republicans are more charitable than Democrats. To support this claim Adelson cited a report from ''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'', which claims, after studying tax data from the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], that U.S. states that vote Republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote Democratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/generous-states-charities-lean-republican/story?id=17030246|title=The Most Generous States: Republican and Religious|first=Susanna|last=Kim|date=August 20, 2012|publisher=[[ABC News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901133157/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/generous-states-charities-lean-republican/story?id=17030246|archive-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> \"My father, who kept a charity box for the poor in our house{{nbsp}}... would have frowned on this fact about modern Democrats.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204712904578092670469140316|first=Sheldon G.|last=Adelson|title=Sheldon G.

      "Adelson also stated that he did not agree with every Republican position and was liberal on several social issues; but he believed the Republicans were better at supporting liberal democracies like Israel, better exemplified the spirit of charity, and supported economic policies that would certainly be better for those Americans now looking for work.",
