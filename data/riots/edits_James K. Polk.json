      "Historians have praised Polk for having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with the risk of war, he reached a settlement with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] over the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed]] [[Oregon Country]], the territory, for the most part, is divided along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].

He secured a substantial reduction of [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] rates with the [[Walker tariff]] of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the [[Independent Treasury]] system. Historian [[Thomas A.

Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land, a cotton plantation near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]], hoping to increase his income. The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south. From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life.

The amount expended was $2,250. In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600. This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 15–17, 32</ref>",

      "The expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 16</ref> In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee.<ref>Greenberg, p. 74</ref> Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons. Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: \"that as my ''private business'' does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 17–18, 21–22</ref>",
      "",
      "Polk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law. Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an [[estate sale]]; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit. The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more. Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child. None of the other slaves Polk purchased as president, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 20–21</ref>",
      "",
      "Discipline for those owned by Polk varied over time. At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|overseer]] named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent. Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work. Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, \"even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 28–31</ref> Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming. His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of [[dysentery]] in 1839. Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves. There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 32–41</ref>",
      "",
      "Polk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead. The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery in the United States. By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 77–79</ref>",

      "'''James Knox Polk''' (November 2, 1795&nbsp;– June 15, 1849) was the 11th [[president of the United States]], serving from 1845 to 1849. He previously was [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (1835–1839) and [[Governor of Tennessee]] (1839–1841). A protégé of [[Andrew Jackson]], he was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and an advocate of [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States through the [[Mexican–American War]]; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the [[annexation of Texas|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Oregon Territory]], and the [[Mexican Cession]] following the American victory in the Mexican–American War.",
      "",
      "After building a successful law practice in [[Tennessee]], Polk was elected to [[Tennessee Legislature|the state legislature]] in 1823 and then to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson. After serving as chairman of the [[Ways and Means Committee]], he became Speaker of the House in 1835, the only president to have been speaker. Polk left Congress to run for governor of Tennessee; he won in 1839 but lost in 1841 and 1843. He was a [[dark horse]] candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]]; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president, but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk defeated [[Henry Clay]] of the rival [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].",
      "",
      "Historians have praised Polk for having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with risk of war, he reached a settlement with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] over the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed]] [[Oregon Country]], the territory for the most part being divided along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. He provoked a war with Mexico in an attempt to expand the nation and succeeded in doing so, as it resulted in Mexico's cession of nearly all the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. He secured a substantial reduction of [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] rates with the [[Walker tariff]] of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the [[Independent Treasury]] system. True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee, where he died three months after leaving the White House.",
      "",
      "Though relatively obscure today, scholars have [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|ranked]] Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda, despite limiting himself to a single term. However, he has also been criticized for leading the country into an aggressive war against Mexico and thus exacerbating divides between [[Free state (United States)|free]] and [[slave state]]s. An owner of property who used slave labor for most of his adult life, he owned a plantation in Mississippi and increased his slave ownership while president. The prime legacy of Polk's presidency of territorial expansion – with the United States reaching the Pacific coast and, roughly, its present contiguous borders – was a nation poised to become a world power, but with sectional divisions gravely exacerbated. Tensions between pro- and anti-slave settlers in the conquered west (not limited to [[Bleeding Kansas]]) and the bid to constitute newfound states as either free or slave – and thus for control of the Senate – set the stage for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], considered a direct consequence of Polk's presidency.",

Alejandro José Atocha, knew Santa Anna and acted initially as an intermediary. Polk noted his contacts with Atocha in his diary, who said that Santa Anna was interested in concluding a treaty with the U.S. gaining territory while Mexico received payment that would include settling its debts. Polk decided that Atocha was untrustworthy and sent his own representative, [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]], (a relative of John Slidell) to meet with Santa Anna. Mackenzie told Santa Anna that Polk wished to see him in power and that if they came to an agreement that the U.S. naval blockade would be lifted briefly to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico. Polk requested $2 million from Congress to be used to negotiate a treaty with Mexico or payment to Mexico before a treaty was signed. The blockade was indeed briefly lifted and Santa Anna returned to Mexico, not to head a government that would negotiate a treaty with the U.S., but rather to organize a military defense of his homeland.

      "==Polk and slavery==",
      "Polk was a slaveholder for most of his adult life. His father, Samuel Polk, in 1827 left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land, and divided about 53 slaves among his widow and children in his will. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] land that his father had left him near [[Somerville, Tennessee]]. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land, a cotton plantation near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]], hoping to increase his income. The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south. From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life. He occasionally visited<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 13–15</ref>—for example, he spent much of April 1844 on his Mississippi plantation, right before the Democratic convention.<ref>Greenberg, p. 33</ref>",
      "",
      "Adding to the inherited slaves, in 1831, Polk purchased five more, mostly buying them in Kentucky, and expending $1,870; the youngest had a recorded age of 11. As older children sold for a higher price, slave sellers routinely lied about age. Between 1834 and 1835, he bought five more, aged from 2 to 37, the youngest a granddaughter of the oldest. The amount expended was $2,250. In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600. This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 15–17, 32</ref>",
      "",
      "The expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 16</ref> In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee.<ref>Greenberg, p. 74</ref> Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons. Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: \"that as my ''private business'' does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 17–18, 21–22</ref>",
      "",
      "Polk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law. Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an [[estate sale]]; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit. The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more. Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child. None of the other slaves Polk purchased as president, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 20–21</ref>",
      "",
      "Discipline for those owned by Polk varied over time. At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|overseer]] named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent. Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work. Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, \"even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 28–31</ref> Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming. His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of [[dysentery]] in 1839. Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves. There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 32–41</ref>",
      "",
      "Polk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead. The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery in the United States. By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 77–79</ref>",
      "",
