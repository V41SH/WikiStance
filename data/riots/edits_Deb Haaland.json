      "Making history is one of the best things you can do as a minority group in American politics. New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland is doing just that and more when she got confirmed by the senate to be the Interior Secretary. [[United States Senate]] Democrat [[Tina Smith]] had a good take on this moment saying that “time after time, strong women, and especially women of color, are attacked when white men with the same views are welcome to walk right through that door, unopposed”. It is extremely important that the senate be as diverse at least as much as it is compared to the United States.<ref></ref>",
      "Native American people have always been underrepresented in congress and underpaid for the crimes committed that were committed against them. Rep. Haaland is an enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna Native American tribe in New Mexico. She will have a diverse take on issues that we are facing as a nation. Especially when the issues revolve around land rights, health care, and sacred site protection. All environmental groups are excited to have a great addition to the Democratic party. The recent legislation drafted on environmental issues seems to line up perfectly with the values of Rep. Haaland.<ref></ref>"
