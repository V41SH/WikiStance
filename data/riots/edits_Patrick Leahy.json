      "Leahy is a fan of the [[Grateful Dead]]. He has not only attended concerts, but has a collection of the band's tapes in his Senate Offices. [[Jerry Garcia]] visited him at his Senate offices, and Leahy gave a tie designed by Garcia to Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (who responded by giving Leahy a [[Rush Limbaugh]] tie). Surviving band members [[Bob Weir]] and [[Mickey Hart]] have participated in fund-raisers for Leahy and his [[Political Action Committee]], the Green Mountain Victory Fund. Leahy appeared in a videotaped tribute to the Dead when they received a lifetime achievement award at the 2002 [[Jammys]]. His Senate website notes this response to a question from seventh-grade students from Vermont's [[Thetford Academy, Vermont|Thetford Academy]] who asked Leahy which Dead song was his favorite, he replied: \"... my favorite is \"Black Muddy River\" but we always play \"[[Truckin']]\" on election night at my headquarters.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}",
