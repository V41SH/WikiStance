      "In 2003, Eugene Fields received a six-year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)|Mothers Against Drunk Driving]]. A spokeswoman for Huckabee, [[Charmaine Yoest]], said that Fields's political donations [to the Arkansas Republican Party] and connections played no role in his clemency. About two years after Fields's sentence was cut to 11 months, he was arrested again for driving while intoxicated as his truck crossed the center line directly into the path of an oncoming police car.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Long Run: Charming and Aloof, Huckabee Changed State |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[Little Rock, AR]]|date=December 22, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/us/politics/22commute.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1198343576-wqXZD02A72A4LL3ZAHATxw |access-date=November 30, 2009 |first=David |last=Barstow}}</ref>"
