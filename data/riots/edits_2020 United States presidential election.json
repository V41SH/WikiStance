In a highly polarized political environment, acrimonious campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens.

      "Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts attributed this to several factors, including a \"[[Blue shift (politics)|red mirage]]\" of early results being counted in relatively thinly-populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, causing those ballots to favor Biden even more. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early [[Blue shift (politics)|blue shift]] giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=David|date=November 3, 2020|title=Beware the 'blue mirage' and the 'red mirage' on election night|work=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=November 5, 2020|title=Trump blames Democrats for late-counted mail ballots.

In a highly polarized political environment, acrimonious campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens.

      "Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts attributed this to several factors, including a \"[[Blue shift (politics)|red mirage]]\" of early results being counted in relatively thinly-populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, causing those ballots to favor Biden even more. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early [[Blue shift (politics)|blue shift]] giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=David|date=November 3, 2020|title=Beware the 'blue mirage' and the 'red mirage' on election night|work=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=November 5, 2020|title=Trump blames Democrats for late-counted mail ballots.

      "Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts attributed this to several factors, including a \"[[Blue shift (politics)|red mirage]]\" of early results being counted in relatively thinly-populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, causing those ballots to favor Biden even more. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early [[Blue shift (politics)|blue shift]] giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=David|date=November 3, 2020|title=Beware the 'blue mirage' and the 'red mirage' on election night|work=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=November 5, 2020|title=Trump blames Democrats for late-counted mail ballots.

In a highly polarized political environment, acrimonious campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 4, 2020|title=United States of America, General Elections, 3 November 2020: Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions|url=https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/6/469437.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105212346/https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/6/469437.pdf|archive-date=November 5, 2020|access-date=November 6, 2020|work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|page=1}}</ref></blockquote>",

      "Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts attributed this to several factors, including a \"[[Blue shift (politics)|red mirage]]\" of early results being counted in relatively thinly-populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, causing those ballots to favor Biden even more. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early [[Blue shift (politics)|blue shift]] giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=David|date=November 3, 2020|title=Beware the 'blue mirage' and the 'red mirage' on election night|work=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=November 5, 2020|title=Trump blames Democrats for late-counted mail ballots.
