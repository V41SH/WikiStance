      "The storming of the United States Capitol was a [[riot]] and violent attack against the [[117th United States Congress]] on January 6, 2021, carried out by a mob of supporters of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump|Donald]] Trumping an [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|attempt to overturn his defeat]]  in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].<ref name=\"2021-01-11-ap-sinister\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2021|title=Capitol assault a more sinister attack than first appeared|url=https://apnews.com/article/14c73ee280c256ab4ec193ac0f49ad54|access-date=January 12, 2021|quote=Under battle flags bearing Donald Trump's name, the Capitol's attackers pinned a bloodied police officer in a doorway, his twisted face and screams captured on video. They mortally wounded another officer with a blunt weapon and body-slammed a third over a railing into the crowd. 'Hang Mike Pence!' the insurrectionists chanted as they pressed inside, beating police with pipes. They demanded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whereabouts, too. They hunted any and all lawmakers: 'Where are they?' Outside, makeshift gallows stood, complete with sturdy wooden steps and the noose. Guns and pipe bombs had been stashed in the vicinity. ... The mob got stirring encouragement from Trump and more explicit marching orders from the president’s men. 'Fight like hell,' Trump exhorted his partisans at the staging rally. 'Let's have trial by combat,' implored his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, whose attempt to throw out election results in trial by courtroom failed. It's time to 'start taking down names and kicking ass,' said Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.
