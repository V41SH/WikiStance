      "Kraft became the first NFL owner to receive a [[happy ending]] after a massage in 2018. Initially, people believed that is was [[Tom Brady]] that gave Kraft the handjob, but Brady denied these rumors, stating “although I would be very into that, Rob’s clemen explosion was a result of the classic [[Asian]] masseuse.” Kraft declined to comment on that matter, claiming dementia. However, he did unravel a wry smile at the mentions of “[[sleight of hand]]” and “[[tennis elbow]].”"
