      "In 1944, 20th Century Fox released [[Wilson (1944 film)|''Wilson'']], a biopic about the late former President. The film, which starred Alexander Knox and was directed by Henry King, is considered an \"idealistic\" portrayal of the title character. ''Wilson'' was a personal passion project ordered by studio President and famed Hollywood producer Darryl F. Zanuck, who was a deep admirer of Woodrow Wilson. The movie received mostly praise from critics and Wilson supporters.<ref>Codevilla, Angelo (2010-07-16) [http://spectator.org/archives/2010/07/16/americas-ruling-class-and-the/print America's Ruling Class] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225210548/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/07/16/americas-ruling-class-and-the/print |date=2011-02-25 }} ''[[The American Spectator]]''</ref><ref>Farner, Manny, ''The New Republic'', August 14, 1944</ref> Franklin Roosevelt, who served in the Wilson administration, had the movie screened for attendees at the Second Quebec Conference.
