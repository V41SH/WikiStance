      "Another reason for historians' low opinion of Buchanan was his veto of the [[Homestead Act]] and the [[Morrill Act]], both of which were quickly reintroduced and signed into law by Buchanan's immediate successor, [[Abraham Lincoln]].  The Homestead Act accelerated westward expansion by giving away 160 acres of federal land to anyone who was willing to farm it for five years and build a house there.  The Morrill Act accelerated agricultural and engineering research and education by giving away federal land in every state for the purpose of establishing [[land grant universities]] that were focused on those two areas rather than the liberal arts."
