      "Sullivan also competed in the 2018 Olympic Games for Long Track Speed Skating and competed in several World Championships. Starting with the basics on the ‘Learn to Speedskating’ team, Sullivan worked his way up to the competitive team, maintaining a training schedule akin to a full-time job to become an accomplished speed skater.  Sullivan worked odd jobs to make ends meet: “I was a waiter, a busser, a dishwasher, and worked in a call center. I was always stressed because someone was telling me, ‘You have to be at work after practice or you’re fired.’”",
      "",
      "​Sullivan was training 40-50 hours each week, in addition to working on the side. With all that, finding a new flexible way to earn money proved no easy task. His love of speed skating keeps him on track despite these challenges: “I love competing against other people by pushing my limits and seeing how good I can get.” Moving away from home at a young age and jumping into a new sport has taught him many lessons, but most importantly, “When you start something new you won’t be the best right away. It takes time.”",
      "",
      "But Sullivan isn’t afraid of putting in the time. With his supportive family, teammates, coaches, and even Uber, John can confidently pursue his passion."
