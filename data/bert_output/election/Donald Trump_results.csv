 The '''2020 Washington gubernatorial election''' will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the [[governor of Washington]], concurrently with the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential election]], as well as [[2020 United States Senate elections|elections]] to the [[United States Senate]], [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|elections]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] and various [[2020 United States elections|state and local elections]]. The [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|top-two primary]] was held on August 4.

 ==Background==
 Washington has not had a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor since [[John Spellman]] left office in 1985, the longest streak of Democratic leadership of any state in the country and the third longest streak of one-party leadership after [[South Dakota]] (which has not had a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor since [[Harvey L. Wollman]] left office in 1979) and [[Utah]] (which has not had a Democratic governor since [[Scott M.

 When Inslee announced [[Jay Inslee 2020 presidential campaign|his candidacy]] for president, several political figures expressed interest in running for Governor if Inslee won [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|the Democratic primaries]].

 In January 1998, [[Eric Rudolph]] bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.

 ===16th Street Baptist Church bombing case===
 [[File:Doug Jones Cherry Trial (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|Jones during the trial of Bobby Frank Cherry]]
 Jones prosecuted [[Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr.]] and [[Bobby Frank Cherry]], two members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], for their roles in the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]]. The case was reopened the year before Jones was appointed, but did not gain traction until his appointment. A [[federal grand jury]] was called in 1998, which caught the attention of Cherry's ex-wife, Willadean Cherry, and led her to call the FBI to give her testimony. Willadean then introduced Jones to family and friends, who reported their own experiences from the time of the bombing. A key piece of evidence was a tape from the time of the bombing in which Blanton said he had plotted with others to make the bomb. Jones was deputized to argue in state court and indicted Blanton and Cherry in 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/us/church-bombing-trial-begins-birmingham-city-s-past-very-much-present.html|title=As Church Bombing Trial Begins in Birmingham, the City's Past Is Very Much Present|last=Sack|first=Kevin|date=April 25, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/14/nation/la-na-nn-birmingham-bombing-prosecutor-20130913|title=Prosecutor reflects on 50th anniversary of 1963 Birmingham bombing|last=Hennessy-Fiske|first=Molly|date=September 14, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> Blanton was found guilty in 2001 and Cherry in 2002.

 In 2017, Bullock vetoed measures to outlaw [[abortion]]s after 20 weeks, citing constitutional rulings on the women's ability to protect their lives and health and arguing that elected officials should not put personal beliefs above medical professionals' judgment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortion, guns, state plane among bills vetoed by governor |url=https://apnews.com/article/3cd844d6f8f643c897d132c930f19379 |website=[[Associated Press]] |date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Governor Bullock Stands With Montana Families By Vetoing Extreme Bills Endangering Women|url=https://www.aclumontana.org/en/press-releases/governor-bullock-stands-montana-families-vetoing-extreme-bills-endangering-women|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Montana|accessdate=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702093732/https://www.aclumontana.org/en/press-releases/governor-bullock-stands-montana-families-vetoing-extreme-bills-endangering-women|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He has said that he personally believes life begins at [[Fetal viability|viability]] but that ""it's not up to people like me to be making these decisions"".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frazin |first1=Rachel |title=2020 Dem Steve Bullock: I think life begins at viability |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/444444-bullock-i-think-life-begins-at-viability |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |language=en |date=19 May 2019}}</ref> In 2018, Bullock wrote a letter to [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Alex Azar]] requesting that [[Title X]] funding for reproductive health care and [[family planning]] for low-income women remain in effect, saying the program had generated more than $29 million in savings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drake |first1=Phil |title=Bullock repeats opposition to family planning changes |url=https://eu.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/08/03/montana-governor-opposes-trumps-family-planning-changes/900103002/ |website=[[Great Falls Tribune]] |date=August 3, 2018}}</ref>
 
 ===Campaign finance reform===
 As Attorney General of Montana, Bullock advocated on behalf of the state's century-old ban on corporate money in elections, the Montana Corrupt Practices Act of 1912. After that and similar laws were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court's ''[[Citizens United]]'' decision in 2010, Bullock countered with a new case, ''American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v.
