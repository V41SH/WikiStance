His father was a steel salesman.<ref name=Upstart /> He graduated with an A.B. in politics from [[Princeton University]] in 1982 after completing a 94-page long senior thesis titled ""The Politics of [[Prostitution]] and [[Drug liberalization|Drug Legalization]].""<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=Stephen Andrew|date=1982|title=The Politics of Prostitution and Drug Legalization|url=http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp017h149r67p}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/business/09cerb.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0/ |title=For Private Equity, a Very Public Disaster |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 9, 2009}}</ref>  While a student at Princeton, Feinberg captained the [[tennis]] team and joined the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]].<ref name=Upstart />
 
 ==Professional career==
 After graduating from college, Feinberg worked as a trader at [[Drexel Burnham]] in 1982 and later at [[Gruntal & Co.]].<ref name=""Upstart Business Journal"">{{cite web|last1=Roth|first1=Daniel|title=The Most Dangerous Deal in America|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/executives/features/2007/08/13/Stephen-Feinberg-Cerberus.html|publisher=Upstart Business Journal}}</ref>
 
 In 1992, at the age of 32, Feinberg co-founded [[Cerberus Capital Management]] with William L. Richter.<ref name=""Upstart Business Journal"" />  At the time the firm had $10 million under management; its assets under management have since grown to over $30 billion in 2016.<ref name=""Korean Investors"">{{cite web|title=Cerberus' new Europe property fund may attract over $370 mn from Korean investors|url=http://www.koreaninvestors.com/?p=791|publisher=Korean Investors|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cerberuscapital.com/the-firm/ Who We Are - Cerberus Capital Management<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1999, the firm hired former vice president [[Dan Quayle]] as a chairman of Cerberus Global Investment.<ref>[http://www.cerberuscapital.com/team/j-danforth-quayle/ J.

 In May 2011, Feinberg stated that he believed residential mortgage-backed securities may present ""a real opportunity for continued investment for quite a period of time""<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/05/25/is-it-2006-cerberus-loves-mortgage-backed-securities/ |title=Is it 2006?

 Feinberg has been critical about the pay received by private equity executives, stating, ""In general, I think that all of us are way overpaid in this business. It is almost embarrassing.""<ref name=""Reuters"">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/cerberus-idUSN0713981720110607/ |title=Cerberus' Feinberg says PE executives 'way overpaid' |work=Reuters |date=June 7, 2011}}</ref> He has also noted in comments made in 2011 that smaller private equity fund sizes may be better for investor returns: ""If your goal is to maximize your return as opposed to assets under management, I think you can be most effective with a big company infrastructure and a little bit smaller fund size.""<ref name=""Reuters""/>
 
 Feinberg has been described as ""secretive"" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/business/yourmoney/24hedge.html?pagewanted=3&ref=&_r=0/ |title=Can Private Equity Build a Public Face? |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 24, 2006}}</ref>  In 2007, Feinberg told Cerberus shareholders, ""If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him.

 Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his reelection bid, but Aden withdrew from the race on July 8, after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/07/09/ken-aden-dropping-out-of-3rd-district-congressional-race  |title=Ken Aden dropping out of 3rd District congressional race|date=July 9, 2012|access-date=August 15, 2012|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|first=Max|last=Brantley}}</ref> He was reelected with 76% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705043|title=Our Campaigns - AR - District 03 Race - Nov 06, 2012|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>
