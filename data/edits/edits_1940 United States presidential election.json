He criticized perceived incompetence and waste in the [[New Deal]], warned of the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition, and accused Roosevelt of secretly planning to take the country into World War II. However, Willkie's association with [[big business]] damaged his cause, as many [[Working class in the United States|working class]] voters blamed corporations and business leaders for the Great Depression.

      "Throughout the winter, spring, and summer of 1940, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|enshrined in the Constitution]], had been established by [[George Washington]] when he refused to run for a third term in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]; other former presidents, such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] had made serious attempts to run for a third term, but the former failed to be nominated, while the latter, forced to run on a third-party ticket, lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]] due to the split in the Republican vote. President Roosevelt refused to state definitely whether he would run for a third term. He even indicated to some ambitious Democrats that he would not run. Two of them thus decided to seek the Democratic nomination. These were [[James Farley]], his former campaign manager, and Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Garner was a Texas conservative who had come to disagree with Roosevelt's liberal economic and social policies, and declined to run for a third term as vice president.",
      "",
      "However, as [[Nazi Germany]] swept through western Europe and menaced the [[United Kingdom]] in the summer of 1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat the popular Willkie.<ref>James MacGregor Burns ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1956) pp 408-30.</ref>",
      "",
      "At the July [[1940 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Garner. Roosevelt picked Secretary of Agriculture [[Henry A. Wallace]] of Iowa to replace Garner on the ticket. An outspoken liberal who had been a Republican until he joined Roosevelt's cabinet, he met strong opposition from conservatives and party traditionalists. Wallace was also known as \"eccentric\" in his private life: some years earlier, he had been a follower of [[Theosophy|Theosophist]] mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]]. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace he would not run. [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] came to Chicago to vouch for Wallace, and he won the vice-presidential nomination with 626 votes to 329 for House Speaker [[William B. Bankhead]] of Alabama.<ref>Richard Moe, ''Roosevelt's Second Act: The Election of 1940 and the Politics of War'' (2013).</ref>",

      "In the months leading up to the opening of the 1940 [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, the Republican Party was deeply divided between the party's [[United States non-interventionism|isolationists]], who wanted to stay out of [[World War II]] at all costs, and the party's interventionists, who felt that the [[United Kingdom]] needed to be given all aid short of war to prevent [[Nazi Germany]] from conquering all of Europe. The three leading candidates for the Republican nomination - Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] from Michigan, and [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] from New York - were all isolationists to varying degrees.<ref>Michael D. Bowen, ''The Roots of Modern Conservatism: Dewey, Taft, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party'' (2011).</ref>",
      "",
      "Taft was the leader of the conservative, isolationist wing of the Republican Party, and his main strength was in his native [[Midwestern United States]] and parts of the [[Southern United States]]. Dewey, the District Attorney for [[Manhattan]], had risen to national fame as the \"Gangbuster\" prosecutor who had sent numerous infamous [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figures to prison, most notably [[Lucky Luciano]], the organized-crime boss of [[New York City]]. Dewey had won most of the presidential primaries in the spring of 1940, and he came into the Republican Convention in June with the largest number of delegate votes, although he was still well below the number needed to win. Vandenberg, the senior Republican in the Senate, was the \"favorite son\" candidate of the Michigan delegation and was considered a possible compromise candidate if Taft or Dewey faltered. Former President [[Herbert Hoover]] was also spoken of as a compromise candidate.",
      "",
      "However, each of these candidates had weaknesses that could be exploited. Taft's outspoken isolationism and opposition to any American involvement in the [[European theatre of World War II|European war]] convinced many Republican leaders that he could not win a general election, particularly as [[Battle of France|France fell]] to the Nazis in June 1940 and Germany threatened the United Kingdom. Dewey's relative youth—he was only 38 in 1940—and lack of any foreign-policy experience caused his candidacy to weaken as the [[Wehrmacht]] emerged as a fearsome threat. In 1940, Vandenberg was also an isolationist (he would change his foreign-policy stance during World War II) and his lackadaisical, lethargic campaign never caught the voters' attention. Hoover still bore the stigma of having presided over the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the subsequent [[Great Depression]]. This left an opening for a [[dark horse]] candidate to emerge.<ref>Susan Dunn,  ''1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election Amid the Storm'' (Yale UP, 2013).</ref>",
      "",
      "",
      "A [[Wall Street]]-based industrialist named [[Wendell Willkie]], who had never before run for public office, emerged as the unlikely nominee. Willkie, a native of Indiana and a former Democrat who had supported Franklin Roosevelt in the [[1932 United States presidential election]], was considered an improbable choice. Willkie had first come to public attention as an articulate critic of Roosevelt's attempt to break up electrical power [[Monopoly|monopolies]].",
      "",
      "Willkie was the CEO of the [[Commonwealth & Southern Corporation]], which provided electrical power to customers in eleven states. In 1933, President Roosevelt had created the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), which promised to provide [[flood control]] and cheap electricity to the impoverished people of the [[Tennessee Valley]]. However, the government-run TVA would compete with Willkie's Commonwealth & Southern, and this led Willkie to criticize and oppose the TVA's attempt to compete with private power companies. Willkie argued that the government had unfair advantages over private corporations, and should thus avoid competing directly against them.<ref>Steve Neal, ''Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie'' (1989)</ref>",
      "",
      "However, Willkie did not dismiss all of Roosevelt's [[Social programs in the United States|social welfare programs]], indeed supporting those he believed could not be managed any better by the free enterprise system. Furthermore, unlike the leading Republican candidates, Willkie was a forceful and outspoken advocate of aid to the [[Allies of World War II]], especially the United Kingdom. His support of giving all aid to the British \"short of declaring war\" won him the support of many Republicans on the [[East Coast of the United States]], who disagreed with their party's isolationist leaders in Congress.",
      "",
      "Willkie's persuasive arguments impressed these Republicans, who believed that he would be an attractive presidential candidate. Many of the leading [[Media proprietor|press barons]] of the era, such as Ogden Reid of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Roy Howard of the [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard]] newspaper chain and [[John Cowles Sr.|John]] and [[Gardner Cowles Jr.]] publishers of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star]]'' and the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Tribune]]'', as well as ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, supported Willkie in their newspapers and magazines. Even so, Willkie remained a long-shot candidate; the May 8 [[The Gallup Organization#Gallup Poll|Gallup Poll]] showed Dewey at 67% support among Republicans, followed by Vandenberg and Taft, with Willkie at only 3%.",
      "",
      "The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]'s rapid [[Blitzkrieg]] campaign into France in May 1940 shook American public opinion, even as Taft was telling a Kansas audience that America needed to concentrate on domestic issues to prevent Roosevelt from using the war crisis to extend [[socialism]] at home. Both Dewey and Vandenberg also continued to oppose any aid to the United Kingdom that might lead to war with Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, sympathy for the embattled British was mounting daily, and this aided Willkie's candidacy. By mid-June, little over one week before the Republican Convention opened, the Gallup poll reported that Willkie had moved into second place with 17%, and that Dewey was slipping. Fueled by his favorable media attention, Willkie's pro-British statements won over many of the delegates. As the delegates were arriving in Philadelphia, Gallup reported that Willkie had surged to 29%, Dewey had slipped five more points to 47%, and Taft, Vandenberg and Hoover trailed at 8%, 8%, and 6% respectively.",
      "",
      "Hundreds of thousands, perhaps as many as one million, telegrams urging support for Willkie poured in, many from \"Willkie Clubs\" that had sprung up across the country. Millions more signed petitions circulating everywhere. At the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] itself, keynote speaker [[Harold Stassen]], the Governor of Minnesota, announced his support for Willkie and became his official floor manager.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Hundreds of vocal Willkie supporters packed the upper galleries of the convention hall. Willkie's amateur status and fresh face appealed to delegates as well as voters. Most of the delegations were selected not by primaries, but by party leaders in each state, and they had a keen sense of the fast-changing pulse of public opinion. Gallup found the same thing in polling data not reported until after the convention: Willkie had moved ahead among Republican voters by 44% to only 29% for the collapsing Dewey. As the pro-Willkie galleries chanted \"We Want Willkie!\" the delegates on the convention floor began their vote. Dewey led on the first ballot, but steadily lost strength thereafter. Both Taft and Willkie gained in strength on each ballot, and by the fourth ballot it was obvious that either Willkie or Taft would be the nominee. The key moments came when the delegations of large states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York left Dewey and Vandenberg and switched to Willkie, giving him the victory on the sixth ballot.<ref>Henry Z. Scheele, \"The Nomination of Wendell Willkie.\" ''Communication Quarterly'' 16.4 (1968): 45-50.</ref>",
      "",
      "Willkie's nomination was one of the most dramatic moments in any political convention.<ref>Charles Peters, ''Five Days in Philadelphia: 1940, Wendell Willkie, FDR and the Political Convention That Won World War II'' (2006) pp 1-5.</ref> Having given little thought to whom he would select as his vice-presidential nominee, Willkie left the decision to convention chairman and Massachusetts Representative [[Joseph William Martin Jr.|Joseph Martin]], the House Minority Leader, who suggested Senate Minority Leader [[Charles L. McNary]] from Oregon. Despite the fact that McNary had spearheaded a \"Stop Willkie\" campaign late in the balloting, the convention picked him to be Willkie's running mate.<ref>Steve Neal, ''McNary of Oregon: A Political Biography'' (1985).</ref>",

Willkie then reversed his approach and charged Roosevelt with secretly planning to take the nation into World War II. This accusation did cut into Roosevelt's support. In response, Roosevelt, in a pledge that he would later regret, promised that he would \"not send American boys into any foreign wars.\" The United Kingdom and Germany actively interfered throughout the election, hoping to exploit public sentiments and cultivate political contacts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Usdin|first1=Steve|title=When a Foreign Government Interfered in a U.S. Election — to Reelect FDR|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/when-a-foreign-government-interfered-in-a-us-electionto-reelect-fdr-214634|access-date=18 January 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"The Conversation\">{{cite news|last1=Hart|first1=Bradley|title=Nazis and communists tried it too: Foreign interference in US elections dates back decades|url=https://theconversation.com/nazis-and-communists-tried-it-too-foreign-interference-in-us-elections-dates-back-decades-109934|access-date=23 January 2019|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=23 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|title=A Nazi Attempt To Influence U.S. Elections|url=https://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/23/nazis/|work=[[CNN]]|date=23 July 1997}}</ref>",

Willkie did get over six million more votes than the Republican nominee in 1936, [[Alf Landon]], and he ran strong in [[rural]] areas in the American [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], taking over 57% of the farm vote. Many counties in the Midwest have not voted for a Democrat since. Roosevelt, meanwhile, carried every American city with a population of more than 400,000 except [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. Of the 106 cities with more than 100,000 population, he won 61% of the votes cast; in the [[Southern United States]] as a whole, he won 73% of the total vote. In the remainder of the country (the rural and small-town [[Northern United States]]), Willkie had a majority of 53%. In the cities, there was a class differential, with the white-collar and middle-class voters supporting the Republican candidate, and working class, blue-collar voters going for FDR. In the North, Roosevelt won 87% of the Jewish vote, 73% of the Catholics, and 61% of the nonmembers, while all the major Protestant denominations showed majorities for Willkie.<ref>Richard Jensen,  \"The Cities Reelect Roosevelt\" p 189-90</ref>",

This marked the first time since 1892 that the Democrats won the popular vote in three consecutive elections, and the first since 1840 where they won three consecutive elections. Although at a rate lower than 1936, Roosevelt maintained his strong majorities from labor unions, big city [[political machine]]s, ethnic minority voters, and the traditionally Democratic [[Solid South]].

Davis was sympathetic to the German cause after his meeting with [[Hermann Göring]] and was enlisted for this purpose. Later, he directed some of these funds towards supporting anti-Roosevelt radio broadcasts by the isolationist labor leader [[John L. Lewis]], with the aim of impeding Roosevelt's re-election bid. Initially a supporter of Roosevelt in 1936, Davis had become disillusioned by 1940, and the two had grown apart over foreign policy. The German envoy in Mexico had also requested $160,000 to sway an unnamed Democratic Party operative in Pennsylvania to unseat interventionist Democratic Senator [[Joseph Guffey]], who was a prominent critic of Nazi Germany. Davis was later identified as [[Abwehr]] agent C-80 following his death in August 1941.<ref name=\"The Conversation\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>",

Roosevelt in 1940 stemmed from domestic and foreign policy concerns. The struggle to organize the steel industry, and after 1938, business attempts to erode Walsh-Healy and the Fair Labor Standards Act provided the backdrop for the feud. But activities of Nazi agents, working through [[William Rhodes Davis]], increased Lewis' suspicions of Roosevelt's [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] and were important in the decision to support Wendell Willkie.",
