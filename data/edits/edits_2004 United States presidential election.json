      "In sheer numbers, [[John Kerry]] had fewer endorsements than Dean, who was far ahead in the [[superdelegate]] race going into the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses in January 2004]]. However, Kerry led the endorsement races in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Nevada. His main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for Kerry's campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as being in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager [[Jim Jordan (political consultant)|Jim Jordan]]. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] assigned [[Mary Beth Cahill]] to be the new campaign manager, as well as Kerry's [[Mortgage loan|mortgaging]] his home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the \"magical\" [[Michael Whouley]] who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for [[Al Gore]] in 2000 against [[Bill Bradley]]."
