      "During Musk's first campaign appearance with Donald Trump in October 2024, he urged the crowd to register to vote, portraying Democrats as a threat to democracy. Speaking at a rally in [[Butler, Pennsylvania|Butler]], Musk stressed the urgency of voter registration, claiming the upcoming election was crucial for protecting free speech and constitutional rights. Trump, addressing the audience, referenced a recent assassination attempt against him and accused his opponents of trying to thwart his efforts. The rally featured several prominent speakers, all echoing the sentiment that this election was critical for the future of the country, while investigations into threats against Trump remained ongoing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss |first=Daniel |title=Musk casts Democrats as a threat in first trail appearance with Trump  |date=2024-10-05 |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/musk-trump-rally-butler/index.html |access-date=2024-10-07}}</ref>"

      "By the end of Trump's presidential campaign, [[Elon Musk]] had spent $277 million to elect Trump and allied Republicans, making the largest individual political donor of the 2024 election and the largest individual political donor since at least 2010 outside of candidates funding their own campaigns according to [[OpenSecrets]]. Musk's donations primarily went to his Super Pac, America PAC, and ran what ''The Washington Post'' described as most significant get-out-the-vote operation for Trump. Musk also gave $20.5 million to an \"RGB PAC\" that sought to use the name of former Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsberg]] to convince voters that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban. He also launched a $1 million a day giveaway for swing state voters the Justice Department warned could potentially violate federal election laws. Musk beat Trump's second largest donor, Timothy Mellon, by roughly $80 million.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Thadani |first1=Trisha |last2=Morse |first2=Clara Ence |date=December 6, 2024 |title=Elon Musk is now America's largest political donor |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/06/elon-musk-trump-campaign-spending-fec/ |access-date=December 31, 2024 |website=The Washington Post |language=en |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>"
