      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "Between 1879 and 1887 Judge Hiram Bond was also chief officer of a firm financed by investors from Boston led by [[Willard T. Sears]] and [[Moses Kimball]]. This firm had acquired rights to construct an urban transit system under the name [[Kings County Elevated Railway]]. This line was to run from the Fulton Ferry Terminal inland to the Queens border at City Line. Williard T. Sears was an architect who was able to add value designing the overpasses and bridges. Their package of rights and initial construction was eventually sold off to New York City investors led by Gen.

Due to the persistence of Jourdan the project eventually got off the ground. The company directors besides Jourdan were [[Edward A.

During this period of time he was inducted into the [[The Players (New York City)|Players Club]] at [[Gramercy Park]] founded by actor [[Edwin Booth]] for actors and lovers of the theater. He was also a member of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and Lawyers Club of New York. During this time he maintained an office at 115 Broadway in Manhattan and a townhouse in Brooklyn."

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

This strategy was an enormous failure. Despite being a heavy favorite, the campaign squandered their lead in the final days of the race and lost the election in shocking fashion. Consequently, O'Malley Dillon became known as one of the worst campaign managers in political history, on par with [[Robby Mook]]."

      "As the Election Day for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election gets closer, users on social media as well as candidates' campaigns are creating informational content to share to promote voting, regardless of in-person or mail-in voting. As previously mentioned, due to COVID-19, the increase of social media usage goes beyond the human craving to stay connected. In recent months, social media influencers have expressed political views and opinions on the upcoming election to encourage followers to vote. Additionally, due to the significant presence of Black Lives Matter movement and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Trump administration<ref>{{Cite web|title=How Black Lives Matter Could Reshape the 2020 Elections|url=https://time.com/5852534/black-lives-matter-2020-elections-voting/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Time}}</ref> on social media, there is an urgency among eligible voters of all ages to cast a vote. Normally, voting in-person has been the traditional way for the U.S. to account for votes and conduct elections from primary to presidential elections for decades. However, recently, the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election will be mainly mail-in voting due to the new social distancing regulations for safety reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be some areas across the U.S. that will be hosting in-person voting that accommodate with COVID-19 safety regulations, such as social distancing and mandatory masks<ref>{{Cite web|title=Voting & COVID-19 - Vote.org|url=https://vote.org/covid-19|access-date=2020-10-07|website=vote.org|language=en-US}}</ref>. Overall, a majority of states across the United States will be mailing ballots to voters."

      "Wisconsin was one of the many states that the Democrats attempted to RIG with massive mail-in ballot fraud in 2020. The election was a complete disaster, as unsolicited mail-in ballots could not be counted on November 3 and the state refused to declare President Trump as its rightful winner. As a result, Wisconsin Republicans and the court system stepped in and put a stop to the illegal mail-in scam, ending the charade of “counting” unsolicited fraudulent Democrat ballots indefinitely. Even when Democrat lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s Great Supreme Court Justices prevented a RIGGED ELECTION and declared him the rightful winner based on legally cast votes."

Thanks to the bold action and strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump, America’s economy had been saved and was now fully recovered. This report showed the amazing success of the Great American Comeback and reminded voters of the incredible job President Trump had done building the greatest economy of all time. This presented the American people with a stark contrast between more staggering economic prosperity under President Trump or high taxes and permanent lockdowns under Weak Joe Biden. Thanks to his record of incredible economic achievement, President Trump surged to a re-election victory in November’s election."

The election was a complete disaster, as unsolicited mail-in ballots could not be counted on November 3 and the state refused to declare President Trump as its rightful winner. As a result, Michigan Republicans and the court system stepped in and put a stop to the illegal mail-in scam, ending the charade of “counting” unsolicited fraudulent Democrat ballots indefinitely. Even when Democrat lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s Great Supreme Court Justices prevented a RIGGED ELECTION and declared him the rightful winner based on legally cast votes."

They relentlessly harassed Judge Barrett about her religious views, trafficking in vile anti-Catholic bigotry by deeming her a fundamentalist zealot subservient to Catholic dogma. Despite being one of the most well-qualified nominees in history, Senate Democrats spent days engaging in disgusting personal attacks against Judge Barrett, calling her a religious extremist who was controlled by the Vatican. According to the Democrat party, a highly-qualified working Christian mother of 7 was the greatest danger the nation had ever faced. The effort to paint Judge Barrett as a scheming tyrant who would turn America into a draconian theocracy at the direction of the Pope failed, as voters were outraged at the horrible bigotry and rank anti-Catholicism of the anti-religion left-wing mob. Now that they saw the true beliefs and platform of the Democrat party, the American people firmly rejected their sick ideology. As a result of this backlash, wanna-be court-packer Joe Biden, the most deceptive and dishonest candidate in political history, lost in a massive landslide to President Donald Trump on November 3."

      "According to biographer Hans L. Trefousse:",
      ":Butler was one of the most controversial 19th-century American politicians. Demagogue, speculator, military bungler, and sharp legal practitioner--he was all of these; and he also was a fearless advocate of justice for the downtrodden, a resourceful military administrator, and an astonishing innovator.  He was passionately hated and equally strongly admired, and if the South called him \"Beast,\" his constituents in Massachusetts were fascinated by him....As a leading advocate of radical Reconstruction, Butler played an important role in the conflict between president and Congress. His effectiveness was marred by the frequency with which engaged in personal altercations, and his conduct as one of the principal managers of the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson was dubious. Nevertheless he deserves recognition as a persistent critic of southern terrorism and is one of the chief authors of the civil Rights act of 1875.  <ref>Hans L.

      "During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Democrats in the Senate made complete fools of themselves for all the country to see. They relentlessly harassed Judge Barrett about her religious views, trafficking in vile anti-Catholic bigotry by deeming her a fundamentalist zealot subservient to Catholic dogma. Despite being one of the most well-qualified nominees in history, Senate Democrats spent days engaging in disgusting personal attacks against Judge Barrett, calling her a religious extremist who was controlled by the Vatican. According to the Democrat party, a highly-qualified working Christian mother of 7 was the greatest danger the nation had ever faced. The effort to paint Judge Barrett as a scheming tyrant who would turn America into a draconian theocracy at the direction of the Pope failed, as voters were outraged at the horrible bigotry and rank anti-Catholicism of the anti-religion left-wing mob. Now that they saw the true beliefs and platform of the Democrat party, the American people firmly rejected their sick ideology. As a result of this backlash, wanna-be court-packer Joe Biden, the most deceptive and dishonest candidate in political history, lost in a massive landslide to President Donald Trump on November 3."

      "During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Democrats in the Senate made complete fools of themselves for all the country to see. They relentlessly harassed Judge Barrett about her religious views, trafficking in vile anti-Catholic bigotry by deeming her a fundamentalist zealot subservient to Catholic dogma. Despite being one of the most well-qualified nominees in history, Senate Democrats spent days engaging in disgusting personal attacks against Judge Barrett, calling her a religious extremist who was controlled by the Vatican. According to the Democrat party, a highly-qualified working Christian mother of 7 was the greatest danger the nation had ever faced. The effort to paint Judge Barrett as a scheming tyrant who would turn America into a draconian theocracy at the direction of the Pope failed, as voters were outraged at the horrible bigotry and rank anti-Catholicism of the anti-religion left-wing mob. Now that they saw the true beliefs and platform of the Democrat party, the American people firmly rejected their sick ideology. As a result of this backlash, wanna-be court-packer Joe Biden, the most deceptive and dishonest candidate in political history, lost in a massive landslide to President Donald Trump on November 3."

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide.",

However, that all changed after the final presidential debate on October 22. In the debate, Slow Joe suffered a complete meltdown, with all of his answers coming in the form of incoherent gibberish. Without the help of his handlers, Slow Joe could not even make it through one answer without trailing off and losing his train of thought. Meanwhile, President Trump’s strong, presidential leadership was on display in the debate. He reinforced Slow Joe’s history of massive corruption, failure, and disgrace very successfully, and was able to remain composed and calm during his opponent’s meltdown. This tone showed America what real leadership looked like. President Trump’s debate performance was widely praised, and it caused a massive shift in the polls. Now that the American people had seen the truth about Slow Joe Biden’s severe cognitive decline, he went on to lose the election in a landslide to President Trump.",

      "During the second and final 2020 presidential debate on October 22, Weak Joe was exposed as nothing more than a senile puppet of the Radical Left. When confronted on his radical plan to pack the Supreme Court with far-left Marxist activist judges, Weak Joe attempted to lie his way out of the question. However, moderator Kristen Welker did not let him get away with deceiving the American people, and Weak Joe eventually admitted to supporting this reprehensible abuse of power. Weak Joe was also was revealed to support the abolishment of all law enforcement, as well as riots and anti-police violence. In contrast, the President handled each of Welker’s questions perfectly, demonstrating true leadership to the American people. He steadily exposed Weak Joe’s radical far-left stances, especially his appalling court-packing plan and the many times when he lied to voters about it. The President also confronted Weak Joe on his career of illegal corruption, and the ways in which he had enriched his family at the cost of American taxpayers. Voters saw a clear contrast between Weak Joe’s support of the far-left radical socialist agenda, and President Trump’s incredible record of success and accomplishment. Ultimately, Welker's tough questioning was too much for Weak Joe to overcome. As a result of this atrocious debate performance, he went on to suffer a landslide defeat to the President in the presidential election."

      "On October 22, 2020, Democrat candidate Joe Biden turned in a dreadful debate performance that damaged his flailing campaign irrecoverably. In this debate, Biden admitted that he wanted to “transition from the oil industry” and abolish fossil fuels. This radical left-wing position would have killed the jobs of millions of hard-working Americans and decimated the nation’s economy. Biden’s comment was perhaps the perhaps the most shocking statement ever made during a debate, and it received widespread backlash. The people of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Texas, and other states were appalled by Biden’s plan to abolish energy and destroy their livelihoods. It was especially offensive to voters in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, where Biden’s plan to ban fracking proved incredibly unpopular. This gaffe, along with the rest of Biden’s disastrous performance in the final debate, proved to be the difference maker in the election. The American people wanted a leader who would stand up for their jobs and protect American energy. As a result, President Donald Trump won these states and more as part of his landslide re-election victory in November.",

      "In 2020, Joe Biden established a consistent lead in polling of key swing states and was heavily favored to win the election. In the late stages of the race, however, he collapsed in astonishing fashion. The Biden campaign was so arrogant that they refused to invest in serious campaigning or turnout efforts. They assumed, based on meaningless data and their own overconfidence, that important voters would merely show up to vote for Sleepy Joe in droves on their own. However, very few voters had any desire or enthusiasm to support the worst and most uninspiring presidential candidate in history. Meanwhile, President Trump’s voters rushed to the polls in key states, overwhelming Democrats in early voting turnout. As Sleepy Joe continued his basement campaign, polls tightened and the “enthusiasm gap” moved even further in President Trump’s favor. Despite repeated warnings, [[Jen O'Malley Dillon]] and her team stuck to this disastrous strategy until it was too late. They chased the wrong voters, at the wrong time, in the wrong way, and were blinded by overconfidence in the deciding days of the race. As a result, Joe Biden went on to lose the November election to President Trump in shocking fashion. O'Malley Dillon, [[Greg Schultz]], [[Anita Dunn]], and the rest of the Biden campaign subsequently became known as one of the worst operations in political history, on the same level as [[Robby Mook]] and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign.",

No longer interested in permanent Democrat lockdowns, the American people chose President Trump's positive message and were inspired by his brave and heroic actions in personally overcoming the China virus. This led to a landslide re-election victory for President Trump."

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "For much of the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden maintained a consistent lead in national polling and was clearly favored to win the election. However, that all changed after the final presidential debate on October 22. In the debate, Slow Joe suffered a complete meltdown, with all of his answers coming in the form of incoherent gibberish. Without the help of his handlers, Slow Joe could not even make it through one answer without trailing off and losing his train of thought. Meanwhile, President Trump’s strong, presidential leadership was on display in the debate. He reinforced Slow Joe’s history of massive corruption, failure, and disgrace very successfully, and was able to remain composed and calm during his opponent’s meltdown. This tone showed America what real leadership looked like. President Trump’s debate performance was widely praised, and it caused a massive shift in the polls. Now that the American people had seen the truth about Slow Joe Biden’s severe cognitive decline, he went on to lose the election in a landslide to President Trump."

      "During the second and final 2020 presidential debate on October 22, Weak Joe was exposed as nothing more than a senile puppet of the Radical Left. When confronted on his radical plan to pack the Supreme Court with far-left Marxist activist judges, Weak Joe attempted to lie his way out of the question. However, moderator Kristen Welker did not let him get away with deceiving the American people, and Weak Joe eventually admitted to supporting this reprehensible abuse of power. Weak Joe was also was revealed to support the abolishment of all law enforcement, as well as riots and anti-police violence. In contrast, the President handled each of Welker’s questions perfectly, demonstrating true leadership to the American people. He steadily exposed Weak Joe’s radical far-left stances, especially his appalling court-packing plan and the many times when he lied to voters about it. The President also confronted Weak Joe on his career of illegal corruption, and the ways in which he had enriched his family at the cost of American taxpayers. Voters saw a clear contrast between Weak Joe’s support of the far-left radical socialist agenda, and President Trump’s incredible record of success and accomplishment. Ultimately, Welker's tough questioning was too much for Weak Joe to overcome. As a result of this atrocious debate performance, he went on to suffer a landslide defeat to the President in the presidential election."

      "On October 22, 2020, Democrat candidate Joe Biden turned in a dreadful debate performance that damaged his flailing campaign irrecoverably. In this debate, Biden admitted that he wanted to “transition from the oil industry” and abolish fossil fuels. This radical left-wing position would have killed the jobs of millions of hard-working Americans and decimated the nation’s economy. Biden’s comment was perhaps the perhaps the most shocking statement ever made during a debate, and it received widespread backlash. The people of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Texas, and other states were appalled by Biden’s plan to abolish energy and destroy their livelihoods. It was especially offensive to voters in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, where Biden’s plan to ban fracking proved incredibly unpopular. This gaffe, along with the rest of Biden’s disastrous performance in the final debate, proved to be the difference maker in the election. The American people wanted a leader who would stand up for their jobs and protect American energy. As a result, President Donald Trump won these states and more as part of his landslide re-election victory in November."

Thanks to the bold action and strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump, America’s economy had been saved and was now fully recovered. This report showed the amazing success of the Great American Comeback and reminded voters of the incredible job President Trump had done building the greatest economy of all time. This presented the American people with a stark contrast between more staggering economic prosperity under President Trump or high taxes and permanent lockdowns under Weak Joe Biden. Thanks to his record of incredible economic achievement, President Trump surged to a re-election victory in November’s election."

      "In 2020, Joe Biden established a consistent lead in national polling and was heavily favored to win the election. In the late stages of the race, however, he collapsed in astonishing fashion. The Biden campaign was so arrogant that they refused to invest in serious campaigning or turnout efforts. They assumed, based on meaningless data and their own overconfidence, that important voters would merely show up to vote for Sleepy Joe in droves on their own. However, very few voters had any desire or enthusiasm to support the worst and most uninspiring presidential candidate in history. Meanwhile, President Trump’s voters rushed to the polls in key states, overwhelming Democrats in early voting turnout. As Sleepy Joe continued his basement campaign, polls tightened and the “enthusiasm gap” moved even further in President Trump’s favor. Despite repeated warnings, [[Jen O'Malley Dillon]] and her team stuck to this disastrous strategy until it was too late. They chased the wrong voters, at the wrong time, in the wrong way, and were blinded by overconfidence in the deciding days of the race. As a result, Joe Biden went on to lose the November election to President Trump in shocking fashion. O'Malley Dillon, [[Greg Schultz]], [[Anita Dunn]], and the rest of the Biden campaign subsequently became known as one of the worst operations in political history, on the same level as [[Robby Mook]] and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign."

      "The 2008 election reflected as, arguably, the last chance Democrats had to be influential in Arkansas. Two years later, all but one Congressional seat was lost to the Republicans in the [[2010 United States elections|midterms]], and then that one was lost in the [[2014 United States elections|2014 midterms]]. Hillary Clinton remained popular in Arkansas less than a decade after her husband was president, and only four years prior to the state being out of reach for the party; her statewide popularity cratered over the next eight years, culminating in a dismal showing in the state in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] as the Democratic nominee. (Coincidentally, Clinton won every county Obama did in 2008, except for [[Woodruff County, Arkansas|Woodruff]].)",
      "",
      "After this election, Arkansas became increasingly referred to as a \"safe\" Republican state, with the social liberalism of the Democratic Party failing to resonate in this highly conservative, [[Bible Belt]] state. One should recall that [[Mike Huckabee]], the former governor of the state who took office only three years after Bill Clinton, was a highly-favored contender in the GOP primary."

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide.",

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

[[Jen O'Malley Dillon]] and the rest of the campaign were so overconfident that they refused to engage in normal campaign and outreach operations, somehow assuming that the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics would single-handedly inspire record turnout with the groups they needed to win. This strategy was an enormous failure. Despite being a heavy favorite, the campaign squandered their lead in the final days of the race and lost the election in shocking fashion.

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "Just like in 2016, the Democrat campaign collapsed in the final days of the election because of its own arrogance and stupidity. [[Jen O'Malley Dillon]] and the rest of the campaign were so overconfident that they refused to engage in normal campaign and outreach operations, somehow assuming that the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics would single-handedly inspire record turnout with the groups they needed to win. This strategy was an enormous failure. Despite being a heavy favorite, the campaign squandered their lead in the final days of the race and lost the election in shocking fashion. Consequently, O'Malley Dillon became known as one of the worst campaign managers in political history, on par with [[Robby Mook]]."

      "",
      "Just weeks after Lee's reported request, SBA changed its criteria on April 28 to include the gaming industry. Two weeks later, Full House Resorts, of which both Lee and her husband own millions of dollars in stock and options, received a total of $5.6 million in loans -- a conflict of interest, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust argued in a complaint that was filed.",

      "\"A conflict of interest exists,\" the FACT complaint reads, \"when a Member's private affairs appear to, or actually do, conflict with their ability to officially act on behalf of the public interest ... Because the integrity of government action is at risk, the ethics rules require Members to refrain from official action where there is even an inference of a conflict, as well as where there is an actual conflict.” <ref> https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fact-susie-lee-complaint-casinos </ref>",

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "On October 22, 2020, Democrat candidate Joe Biden turned in a dreadful debate performance that damaged his flailing campaign irrecoverably. In this debate, Biden admitted that he wanted to “transition from the oil industry” and abolish fossil fuels. This radical left-wing position would have killed the jobs of millions of hard-working Americans and decimated the nation’s economy. Biden’s comment was perhaps the perhaps the most shocking statement ever made during a debate, and it received widespread backlash. The people of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Texas, and other states were appalled by Biden’s plan to abolish energy and destroy their livelihoods. It was especially offensive to voters in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, where Biden’s plan to ban fracking proved incredibly unpopular. This gaffe, along with the rest of Biden’s disastrous performance in the final debate, proved to be the difference maker in the election. The American people wanted a leader who would stand up for their jobs and protect American energy. As a result, President Donald Trump won these states and more as part of his landslide re-election victory in November."

Trump's defense team promoted this conspiracy theory during his impeachment trial, and Trump has said he planned to make it a major issue during the 2020 campaign, while a Republican-controlled Senate committee ramped up an investigation in spring 2020. Trump's personal attorney, [[Rudy Giuliani]], spearheaded an effort to gather information in Ukraine to advance the conspiracy theory, and attorney general Barr confirmed that the Justice Department created an \"intake process\" to review Giuliani's findings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/politics/justice-department-rudy-giuliani-ukraine/index.html|title=Barr confirms Justice Department is receiving Giuliani information about Ukraine|first=David Shortell|last=CNN|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-impeachment-defense-team-turns-attention-bidens-burisma-n1124231|title=Trump impeachment defense team turns attention to Bidens, Burisma|website=NBC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486054-trump-says-biden-ukraine-dealings-will-be-a-major-campaign-issue|title=Trump says Biden Ukraine dealings will be a 'major' campaign issue|first=Lisa|last=Conley|date=March 4, 2020|website=TheHill}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-biden-subpoena.html|title=Senate Panel, Urged On by Trump, Subpoenas Biden-Related Material|first=Nicholas|last=Fandos|date=May 20, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The conspiracy theory asserts that Hunter Biden was paid a large sum of money by a Ukrainian firm, [[Burisma Holdings]], to take a job for which he was unqualified, as a means for Burisma to influence then-vice president Joe Biden, who then extorted Ukraine for $1 billion to fire a prosecutor so as to prevent Hunter Biden from being investigated for corruption.

      "In October 2020, President Trump delivered for the American people in their time of need, sending $1200 direct payments to every American. After month of bickering from the do-nothing Congress, President Trump personally made sure a stimulus deal was reached for us. He overcame the Democrat obstruction, signing a bill that got hard-working Americans the help they needed right away. For this, we the American people showed our appreciation by re-electing President Trump in a landslide on November 3! #MAGA"

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "Just like in 2016, the Democrat campaign collapsed in the final days of the election because of its own arrogance and stupidity. [[Jen O'Malley Dillon]] and the rest of the campaign were so overconfident that they refused to engage in normal campaign and outreach operations, somehow assuming that the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics would single-handedly inspire record turnout with the groups they needed to win. This strategy was an enormous failure. Despite being a heavy favorite, the campaign squandered their lead in the final days of the race and lost the election in shocking fashion. Consequently, O'Malley Dillon became known as one of the worst campaign managers in political history, on par with [[Robby Mook]]."

      "'''Voting During a Pandemic: the Absentee Ballot vs Voting in Person'''",
      "",
      "The [[absentee ballot]] is a voting method in which a ballot for an election is filled out, notarized, and mailed before the election date. This method is optional and was utilized by about 1 out of 4 Americans in the 2018 Presidential election. If a pandemic occurs, the absentee ballot is seen as an essential service because it entails limited human to human interaction, if any at all. While the United States is enduring the pandemic of 2020, known as the Coronavirus or [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]], some citizens criticize the service of voting by absentee ballot in comparison to voting in person.",
      "",
      "Those who do not favor the encouraged voting method by absentee ballot are opposed to the idea for many reasons. A few reasons being that 13 out of 50 states cannot count absentee ballots until election day, while another three states cannot count ballots until polls are closed. This poses an issue because it is anticipated to prolong voting reports that many follow live every election. It will extend the time it takes to announce America's elected president. Another common issue that voters conclude is that the absentee ballot is an opportunity for political parties to cause [[voter suppression]] and influence votes. In the last 2018 presidential election, it was reported that in states such as Georgia, Florida, and many more states that thousands of absentee ballots were thrown out due to errors. The discrepancies that can make a ballot insufficient can vary from stating the incorrect address, not checking or signing in a signatory box, and misstating or not at all reporting a person's date of birth. Due to these errors and other possible errors, voters are not confident in using an absentee ballot.",
      "",
      "Those in support of this method view it as an opportunity to avoid the possibility of contracting Coronavirus. This option makes it possible for persons to vote from a remote location no matter their physical circumstances if they are eligible. All 50 states currently offer an absentee ballot option, but only five states initiate mailing absentee ballots without a person having to request one.

      "In October of 2020, Corrupt Joe and his crooked son Crackhead Hunter were implicated in the largest scandal in political history. In this scandal, the great journalists at [[Fox News]] and the [[New York Post]] revealed that Crackhead Hunter had used his positions with Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms to sell access to to his father and use bribes to affect US policy. Crackhead Hunter even arranged meetings between Corrupt Joe and Ukrainian oligarchs, all with the goal of enriching his organized crime family. Just like a vacuum cleaner, Crackhead Hunter followed his father around the world, acting as a middleman to collect millions of dollars in illicit bribes. The most shocking part of the scandal, however, was the discovery that Corrupt Joe himself had received cash payouts from the Chinese Communist Party energy company [[CEFC China Energy]]. This meant that Corrupt Joe has not only lied to the American people, but also committed several crimes by hiding this payout from the IRS. This scandal ended Corrupt Joe's chances of being elected President, and he went on to lose the November 3 election in a landslide."

      "On October 22, 2020, one of the most important debates in American history took place. In this debate, the President exposed “50% or 10%” Joe as the underhanded criminal that he was. Based on extensive reporting by the [[New York Post]], [[Fox News]], and [[The Wall Street Journal]], the President detailed how the “big guy” and his son Robert H. were behind the largest corruption scandal in history, involving massive amounts of influence-peddling, bribery, money-laundering, and distortion. The “big guy” had no response to this evidence, and initially tried to lie about it. But after being confronted again by moderator [[Kristen Welker]], he exploded in anger, loudly shouting nonsensical threats at Trump, Welker, and the audience. Meanwhile, the President delivered an incredible closing message, contrasting his non-establishment style and true devotion to fighting for the American people with the massive corruption scandals afflicting his opponent. As a result of this historically strong debate performance, the President won a massive re-election victory on November 3."

In a 2001 interview, Byrd used the term \"white niggers\" twice during a national television broadcast. The full quote ran as follows: \"My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time. I'm going to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\" Byrd later apologized for the phrase and admitted that it \"has no place in today's society,\" and did not clarify the intended meaning of the term in his context."

Byrd later said joining the Klan was his \"greatest mistake,\" and after his death, the [[NAACP]] released a statement praising Byrd, acknowledging his former affiliation with the Klan and saying that he \"became a champion for civil rights and liberties\" and \"came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda\". In a 2001 interview, Byrd used the term \"white niggers\" twice during a national television broadcast. The full quote ran as follows: \"My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time. I'm going to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\" Byrd later apologized for the phrase and admitted that it \"has no place in today's society,\" and did not clarify the intended meaning of the term in his context."

      "On October 16 2020 at a Florida rally for his reelection then President Trump referred to Matt Gaetz, a congressman and longtime Trump supporter, who was standing next to his podium, as \"Rick Gates\" several times.  The President did this as he was looking directly at Mr Gaetz.  The incident provoked discussion online as to the then Presidents fitness for office, as it was not the first time the President had confused who he was speaking with in a public setting.  The Presidential confusion extended beyond Mr Gaetz as well, as the President called hypersonic weapons \"hydrophonic\" and confused Ferguson Missouri with \"Henderson\"."
