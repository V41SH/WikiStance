      "The speech opened with Johnson being introduced to members of the joint session by [[John W. McCormack]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]]. Johnson began by his tribute to President Kennedy and his work. He said: \"All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today.\"{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}} He called Kennedy the \"greatest leader of our time\", and emphasized at the outset that no word was sad enough to gauge the grief that Kennedy's assassination had caused.{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}} He continued,<blockquote>\"The dream of conquering the vastness of space--the dream of partnership across the Atlantic{{Endash}}and across the Pacific as well{{Endash}}the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations{{Endash}}the dream of education for all of our children{{Endash}}the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them{{Endash}}the dream of care for our elderly{{Endash}}the dream of an all-out attack on mental illness{{Endash}}and above all, the dream of equal rights for all Americans, whatever their race or color{{Endash}}these and other American dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication.{{Sic|?}}\"{{Sfn|Johnson|1964|pp=149-156}}</blockquote>Johnson then declared his intention to maintain continuity in [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]]. It was followed by a passage devoted primarily to [[domestic policy]].{{Sfn|Witherspoon|1987|pp=536-537}} He said: \"This Nation will keep its commitments from [[South Vietnam]] to [[West Berlin]].\"{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}} He then asked the members of Congress to decide on [[tax reform]] and a bill to reduce [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]].{{Sfn|Witherspoon|1987|p=536-538}} He asked all Americans for their help,{{Sfn|Dallek|1998|p=56}} saying: \"An assassin’s bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the Presidency. I am here today to say I need your help; I cannot bear this burden alone.\"{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}} Referring to Kennedy's 1960 inaugural address,{{Sfn|Witherspoon|1987|p=536-538}} he said:<blockquote>\"On the 20th day of January, in 1961, John F. Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished 'in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet'. But, he said, 'let us begin'. Today, in this moment of new resolve, I would say to all my fellow Americans, ''let us continue.''\"{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}}</blockquote>Johnson requested for the earliest possible passing of the civil rights law, for which Kennedy had fought for so long.{{Sfn|Bornet|1988|pp=46-47}} He emphasized that [[Equality before the law|equal rights]] had been talked about long enough:{{Sfn|Witherspoon|1987|p=536-538}} \"It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law. All traces of discrimination and oppression based on race or skin color should be eliminated.\"{{Sfn|Johnson|1964|pp=149-156}} He also demanded from Congress to pass a tax reform that would bring tax relief.{{Sfn|Gittinger|Fisher|2004}} The tax reform was conceived in the spirit of a [[Supply-side economics|supply-oriented economic policy]].{{Sfn|Gittinger|Fisher|2004}}{{Sfn|Dallek|1998|pp=71–74}} He said: \"As one who has long served in both Houses of the Congress, I firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch. And I promise you that I shall always respect this{{Nbsp}}... With equal firmness, I believe in the capacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress, despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our Nation, to act--to act wisely, to act vigorously, to act speedily when the need arises.\"{{Sfn|Transcript {{endash}} LBJ Library|1963}} Johnson was aware that such demands could give the appearance of disregarding the autonomy of Congress. He countered this impression by asserting that he firmly believed in the independence and integrity of the legislature. Respect for this autonomy was in line with his deep conviction. With equal steadfastness, he assumed that the Congress was capable of intelligent, energetic, and immediate action. He emphasized: \"The need is here. The need is now. I ask your help.\"{{Sfn|Johnson|1964|pp=149-156}}"

      "The 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was won by Glenn Youngkin in an enormous upset. For months, the liberal mainstream media had said the Virginia would never vote for a Republican and that Creepy Clintonite Terry McAuliffe would win in a rout, but they had no idea how much BACKLASH and OUTRAGE the Democrat party had stirred. All over the great Commonwealth, people were fed up with the far-left agenda of Joe Biden, the most unpopular and hated president in American history. While Joe and Terry were pushing Critical Race Theory, Virginians realized that Democrat socialist policies had wrecked the economy, skyrocketed inflation, and created shortages of anything and everything. Then, in an act of total desperation, Terry and his campaign disgracefully tried to slander Glenn Youngkin as a Neo-Nazi. The people of Virginia were not fooled by these lies, however, and Glenn won BIG, proving that a massive RED WAVE had begun for Republicans across the country!"

After all, the [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconis]], the [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozys]], the [[Marine Le Pen|Le Pens]], the Trumps, are operating inside the democratic apparatus, with its elections, its oppositions, its scandals, etc. But, within this apparatus, they are playing a different score, another music. This is certainly the case with Trump, who is racist, a male chauvinist, violent – all of which are fascist tendencies – but who, in addition, displays a contempt for logic and rationality and a muffled hatred of intellectuals. The music proper to this type of democratic fascism is a discourse that does not worry in the least bit about coherence, a discourse of impulse, comfortable with a few nighttime tweets, and that imposes a sort of dislocation of language, positively flaunting its ability to say everything and its opposite. For these new political figures, the aim of language is no longer to explain anything or to defend a point of view in an articulate manner. Its aim is to produce affects, which are used to create a fleetingly powerful unity, largely artificial but capable of being exploited in the moment.}}",

      "Retrospectively, in 1974, historian James Banner criticized Madison for his protection of a corrupt General [[James Wilkinson]] in the Army. Wilkinson had been involved in the [[Burr Conspiracy|Aaron Burr conspiracy]] during the Jefferson Administration, was on retainer of Spain, and had a high mortality rate among soldiers. Wilkinson had also botched a campaign during the [[War of 1812]]. Madison finally mustered Wilkinson out of the Army in 1815.{{sfn|Banner Jr.|1974|pp=35–37, 45}}"

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under Presidents [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.",
      "",
      "The Democratic Party has changed significantly during its more than two centuries of existence. During the 19th century the party supported or tolerated slavery, and it opposed civil rights reforms after the American Civil War in order to retain the support of Southern voters. From 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s–1920s) and opposed imperialistic expansion abroad while sponsoring liberal reforms at home.",
      "Starting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the party dominated during the [[Fifth Party System]], which lasted from 1932 until about 1970s. In response to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]], the party employed [[Social liberalism|liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat financial crises and emergency bank closings, with policies continuing into [[World War II]]. The Party kept the [[White House]] after Roosevelt's death in April 1945, reelecting former Vice President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1948. During this period, the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] only successfully elected one president (Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956) and was the minority in Congress all but twice (the exceptions being 1946 and 1952). Powerful committee chairmanships were awarded automatically on the basis of seniority, which gave power especially to long-serving Southerners.  Important Democratic leaders during this time included Presidents Harry S. Truman (1945–1953), [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961–1963) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963–1969). Republican [[Richard Nixon]] won the White House in 1968 and 1972, leading to the end of the New Deal era.",
      "",
      "Democrats have won six out of the last twelve presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]], 1977–1981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]], 1993–2001), [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]], 2009–2017), and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] (with 46th President [[Joe Biden]], 2021–present). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in both elections (with candidates [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively).

      "Flynn became active on speaking tours in 2021. A controversy arose in September 2021 when during a prayer he gave in Nebraska he invoked the terms \"sevenfold rays\" and \"legions,\" terms  some of his QAnon followers said were not consistent with Christian doctrine and suggested he had turned to Satanism. Flynn attempted to dispel this, but some followers remained unconvinced. During the prayer, Flynn used language strikingly similar to that used by [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], leader of the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], an anticommunist [[doomsday cult]] that about thirty years earlier had built fallout shelters and stockpiled guns in Montana in anticipation of a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Flynn had also appeared at a QAnon conference in April 2021 with an Oklahoma gubernatorial candidate whom Flynn had endorsed. The candidate later posted on social media a photo of his daughter wearing red shoes;  QAnon followers consider red shoes to be a sign of their Satanic sex-trafficking cabal theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-flynn-to-qanon-believers-im-not-a-satanist|title=Michael Flynn to QAnon Believers: I’m Not a Satanist!|first=Will|last=Sommer|date=October 8, 2021|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}</ref>"

      "In 2011, Jackson assisted the wrongful conviction crusade of John Walker, an African American man from Buffalo, New York, who, in 1976, when he was just 16 years old, was falsely charged along with four of his closest friends, of having committed a brutal robbery/murder. The victim was an elderly Caucasian man named William Crawford. Mr. Crawford, who also lived in Buffalo, was assaulted after leaving a bar across the street from his home, on Friday, January 2, 1976. Walker and his friends were innocent and had verifiable alibis, but the Buffalo Police Department, and the Erie County District Attorney's Office, pursued them as suspects nonetheless. Moreover, when one of the youths caved in under what he would years later describe as having been intense intimidation and coercion antics on the part of the Buffalo Police Department personnel who interrogated him, the youths were indicted. In 1977, four of the youths were tried for the crime. Three were convicted, one was acquitted. Walker, Darryl Boyd, and Darryn Gibson were sentenced to 17-to-life, 20-to-life, and 25-to-life, respectively, and they were all sent to adult-population New York State prisons. Walker, after having been incarcerated for a total of 22 years, was released on lifetime parole terms, in 2000. In Upstate Western New York, the youths are referred to as [https://facebook.com/thebuffalo5 The Buffalo 5], but their birth names, are John Walker, Darryl Boyd, Darryn Gibson (deceased), Floyd Martin (deceased), and Tyrone Woodruff.

Dent, Sr.]] and others put together in 1968, opposition to the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] would have been a central part of keeping the South. Now you don't have to do that.

So you say stuff like [[desegregation busing|forced busing]], [[states' rights]] and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, \"We want to cut this\", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \"Nigger, nigger\". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the back-burner.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lamis |first=Alexander P. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18051532 |title=The Two Party South |date=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-505680-9 |location=New York |pages=26 |oclc=18051532}}</ref></blockquote>",

      "<blockquote>''Atwater:'' But Reagan did not have to do a southern strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.",

The complaint alleges that this statute treats similarly situated candidates differently without sufficient justification and violates the First and 14th Amendments. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that the ballot order statute violates the First and 14th Amendments by taking “a side in partisan elections.” Republican intervenor-defendants appealed the decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated the district court’s judgment and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.",

Baker (government attorney)|James Baker]] during a September 2016 meeting that he was not representing a client for their discussion. Durham alleged Sussman was actually representing \"a U.S. Technology Industry Executive, a U.S. Internet Company and the Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign.\" Sussmann focuses on  privacy and cybersecurity law and had approached Baker to discuss what he claimed to be suspicious communications between computer servers at the Russian [[Alfa-Bank]] and the [[Trump Organization]]. Sussmann had represented the [[Democratic National Committee]] regarding the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|Russian hacking of its computer network]]. Sussmann's attorneys have denied he was representing the Clinton campaign. Perkins Coie represented the Clinton presidential campaign,and oneofits partners, [[Marc Elias]], commissioned [[Fusion GPS]] to conduct [[opposition research]] on Trump, which led tothe production ofthe controversial [[Steele dossier]]. Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor, characterized the allegations against him as politically motivated and pleaded not guilty the day after his indictment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/special-counsel-appointed-trump-doj-may-indict-democratic-lawyer-sussmann-n1279353|title=Special counsel named by Trump DOJ charges Democratic lawyer with false statement|author1=Ken Dilanian |author2=Tom Winter|date=September 16, 2021|website=NBC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/politics/durham-michael-sussmann-trump-russia.html|title=Durham Is Said to Seek Indictment of Lawyer at Firm With Democratic Ties|first1=Charlie|last1=Savage|first2=Adam|last2=Goldman|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=William K.|last4=Rashbaum|date=September 15, 2021|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/17/politics/michael-sussmann/index.html|title=Michael Sussmann, lawyer charged in Durham probe, pleads not guilty|first=Katelyn Polantz, CNN Reporter, Crime and|last=Justice|date=September 17, 2021|website=CNN}}</ref>"

The current version heavily focuses on the Federal Government and Donald Trump, creating the image that US Government disinformation occurred at the Federal level, and ended with the Trump Administration.  Actually, disinformation has also been promoted by some local governments, including well into the Biden Administration, which have resulted in large scale flare ups and hospital congestion.  For example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have repeatedly lied about the risk of the disease, the effectiveness of vaccines, masking, and social distancing; they have instead implemented policies that have led to much higher number of cases and deaths, in contrast with other states.  While the Biden Administration is not responsible for the state level actions, time-wise, disinformation has continued after Trump left office.>>{{short description|Disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic propagated by officials of the U.S. government}}"

Her published research on the topic spans over a decade and includes her full-length, peer reviewed book, ''The Myth of Voter Fraud,'' ... .Dr. Minnite testified that when she began researching the issue of voter fraud, ..., she began with a 'blank slate' about the conclusions she would ultimately draw from the research. ... Although she admits that noncitizen registration and voting does at times occur, Dr. Minnite testified that there is no empirical evidence to support Defendant's claims in this case that noncitizen registration and voting in Kansas are largescale problems. ... [M]any of these cases reflect isolated incidents of avoidable administrative errors ... and / or misunderstanding on the part of applicants. ... For example, 100 individuals in ELVIS [the Kansas Election Voter Information System] have birth dates in the 1800s, indicating that they are older than 118. And 400 individuals have birth dates after their date of registration, indicating they registered to vote before they were born. ... The voting rate among purported noncitizen registrations on [a Kansas temporary drivers license] match list is around 1%, whereas the voting rate among registrants in Kansas more generally is around 70%.”{{sfn|Robinson|2018|pp=52-58}}",
