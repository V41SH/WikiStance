 First-term Democrat [[Richard L. Neuberger]] had been diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in 1958 that became terminal by 1960 — but was kept from the public. Neuberger remained at home in early 1960, reportedly battling the flu. Though still publicly seeking re-election, he told his campaign chair, attorney Jack Beatty, ""Remember, there's always another Neuberger,"" referring to his wife. The comment, combined with Neuberger's reluctance to meet in public and weak voice on the phone, led Beatty to believe that Neuberger's condition was grave, a suspicion confirmed by the Senator's physician shortly before Neuberger died at Good Samaritan Hospital on March 9, 1960.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beatty |first=Jack |title=The Politics of Public Virtue |year=2010 |pages=261–268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 10, 1960 |title=Sen.

 Democratic [[Oregon Supreme Court]] judge [[Hall S. Lusk]] was appointed March 16, 1960 to continue the term, pending a special election in which he was not a candidate.
 
 Primaries were held May 20, 1960, in which Newberger's widow, Democrat [[Maurine B. Neuberger]] and the Republican former-[[Governor of Oregon]] [[Elmo Smith]] easily won nomination.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Campaigns - OR US Senate - D Primary Race - May 20, 1960 |url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=767410 |access-date=July 8, 2020 |website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Campaigns - OR US Senate - R Primary Race - May 20, 1960 |url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=767412 |access-date=July 8, 2020 |website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

 {{For|related races|1962 United States elections}}
 The '''1962 United States Senate elections''' was an election for the [[United States Senate]] which was held in the middle of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s term. His [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] made a net gain of four seats from the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], increasing their control of the Senate.
 
 Both Republican-held senate seats in New Hampshire were up on election day due to a special election. The appointee lost election to a full term to the Democratic challenger while the incumbent Republican was reelected. As such, this is the last time that one of a state's two senate seats, both up on election day, that were held by the same party changed parties.

 Incumbent Democratic Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] defeated [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] in the Democratic primary and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[W. D. Workman Jr.]] in the general election.  The [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] held their [[Primary election|primary]] on June 12, 1962.  [[Olin D. Johnston]], the incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]], faced stiff competition from [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] who argued that Johnston was too liberal and not representative of South Carolina interests.  Johnston merely told the voters that he was doing what he thought was best for the agriculture and textile workers of the state.  Hollings was decisively defeated by Johnston because Johnston used his position as [[United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Post Office and Civil Service Committee]] to build 40 new post offices in the state and thus demonstrate the pull he had in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to bring home the bacon.

 [[W. D. Workman Jr.]], a correspondent for the ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'', faced no opposition from [[South Carolina Republican Party|South Carolina Republicans]] and avoided a [[primary election]].
 
 Both Johnston and Workman supported [[Racial segregation|segregation]], so the campaign centered on the economic issues of the state.  Workman tried to persuade the voters that Johnston's policies were socialist and that he was too closely aligned with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration.  Johnston was a consistent supporter of socialized health care proposals and Workman was able to win considerable support from the medical establishment.  However, the state's citizens were much poorer than that of the rest of the nation and Johnston's class based appeals made him a very popular figure for the downtrodden of both the white and black races.  The competitive nature of this race foresaw the eventual rise of the Republican Party and that South Carolinians were growing increasingly suspicious of policies generated at the federal level.

 In June 2019, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] compared the holding centers for illegal immigrants at the [[Mexico–United States border]] to ""concentration camps"".

 Speaking as Chairwoman at a House Republican Conference in August 2019,  Cheney stated that the successful litigation (''[[Crow Tribe]] et al v. [[Ryan Zinke|Zinke]]'') by Native tribes and environmentalists to return the grizzly bear in [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone]] to the [[Endangered Species Act]] ""was not based on science or facts” but motivated by plaintiffs “intent on destroying our Western way of life.""

 '''Jenny Anne Durkan''' (born May 19, 1958) is an American attorney and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician serving as [[mayor of Seattle]]. She is the daughter of [[Martin Durkan]], who was once considered one of the most powerful politicians in the state. After earning her J.D. degree from [[University of Washington School of Law]] in 1985, Durkan began practicing law as a prosecutor; she had many prominent cases both on behalf of the government and for private parties. During this time she also worked for many nonprofits and advocacy groups, and was briefly Governor [[Mike Lowry]]'s chief lawyer. In October 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] appointed her [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|Western District of Washington]]. She held that position until September 2014.<ref name="" Washington Post"">Jerry Markon and Juliet Eilperin (September 25, 2014).

There she did a range of civil and criminal cases, including representing reporters subpoenaed by the government.
 
 Durkan returned to Seattle in 1991, and established a successful practice focusing on criminal defense and work on behalf of plaintiffs, including the family of Lt.

 ==Millennium Challenge Corporation==
 On November 6, 2009, Obama named Butts to serve as a senior advisor in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer of the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-taps-cassandra-butts-serve-senior-advisor-millennium-challenge-corp|title=President Obama Taps Cassandra Butts to Serve as Senior Advisor at the Millennium Challenge Corporation|publisher=WhiteHouse.gov|date=November 6, 2009|access-date=2009-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113071615/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-taps-cassandra-butts-serve-senior-advisor-millennium-challenge-corp|archive-date=2009-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Butts' departure was considered to be one of the highest-level departures up to that point from the office of the [[White House Counsel]],<ref name=""legaltimes.typepad.com""/> and it was followed one week later by the announcement of the departure of Butts' then-boss, White House Counsel [[Gregory Craig]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zeleny, Jeff|first1=Jeff|last2=Baker|first2=Peter|title=President's Top Lawyer to Step Down|agency=New York Times|work=New York Times|date=November 14, 2009|ref=pg.

 ==Nomination to be Ambassador to the Bahamas==
 On February 7, 2014, Butts was nominated by President Obama to be [[United States Ambassador to the Bahamas]]. The Senate held a committee hearing on her nomination in May 2014, but took no action the rest of the year, and her nomination lapsed with the end of the [[113th United States Congress]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
 
 With the new Congress, Obama renominated her to the post on February 5, 2015. The [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] reported her nomination to the full U.S. Senate on May 21, 2015. However, Butts' nomination was blocked by several Republican senators. First, Sen. [[Ted Cruz]] placed a blanket hold on all U.S. State Department nominees after he was upset with Obama for the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].<ref name=""nytimes.com"">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/opinion/an-obama-nominees-crushed-hopes.html|title=An Obama Nominee's Crushed Hopes|date=June 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> However, after Cruz lifted those holds, Sen. [[Tom Cotton]] then stepped in and once again, to protest an issue unrelated to the specific nominees, blocked Butts' nomination and the nominations of ambassador nominees to Sweden and Norway after the Secret Service had leaked private information about a fellow member of Congress. Cotton later lifted his holds on the nominees to Sweden and Norway, but kept his hold on Butts' nomination.<ref name=""nytimes.com""/>
 
 Butts told New York Times columnist [[Frank Bruni]] that she had visited Cotton about his objections to her nomination, and Cotton told her that because he knew that Obama and Butts were friends, blocking Butts was a way to ""inflict special pain on the president,"" Bruni wrote.<ref name=""nytimes.com""/>  According to Bruni's article, a spokeswoman for Cotton did not dispute Butts' account, but did emphasize Cotton's respect for Butts and for her career.<ref name=""nytimes.com""/>
 
 Butts died on May 25, 2016, still awaiting a Senate vote.<ref name=""nytimes.com""/> For several weeks after Butts' death, her nomination had remained pending before the U.S. Senate on its executive calendar.  Obama formally withdrew her nomination on June 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/10/presidential-nominations-and-withdrawal-sent-senate|title=Presidential Nominations and Withdrawal Sent to the Senate|date=June 9, 2016|work=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>
 
 ==Death==
 Butts was found dead in her [[Washington, D.C.]] home by her sister on May 25, 2016. According to a statement from her family she had suffered from a brief illness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cassandra Q. Butts, Obama law school classmate and adviser, dies at 50|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cassandra-q-butts-obama-law-school-classmate-and-adviser-dies-at-50/2016/05/28/20950d2c-24e1-11e6-9e7f-57890b612299_story.html|date=May 28, 2016|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Bruni wrote that she had suffered from acute leukemia and had not felt ill until just beforehand.<ref name=""nytimes.com""/>

 Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]], the state's primary elections were postponed until August 11, 2020, marking the first time that the modern presidential primary season has extended into August. By that time, incumbent President [[Donald Trump]] of the Republican Party and former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] of the Democratic Party had already clinched enough delegates to become the presumptive nominees of their respective parties. Furthermore, both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions were scheduled one and two weeks afterwards, respectively, essentially making the Connecticut primary races ''[[pro forma]]''.

 Although the Peach State has not voted for a Democrat since 1992, [[Donald Trump|Trump's]] margin was more narrow in the [[2016 United States presidential election in Georgia|2016 election]] due to the state's fast-growing and diverse population, as seen in the ""flipping blue"" of several of Atlanta's inner suburban counties for the first time since favorite son [[Jimmy Carter|Carter's]] campaign. Georgia is seen as a key [[battleground state]] in both the presidential and [[2020 United States Senate election in Georgia|Senatorial]] elections.
 
 By the time that the primary elections were held in the state on June 9, 2020, incumbent President [[Donald Trump]] was already the Republican Party's [[presumptive nominee]], being the only viable declared major candidate left. On the Democratic Party's side, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive nominee after [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]], his last competitor, withdrew on April 8, 2020.

 ==Early career==
 After law school, Klobuchar worked as a corporate lawyer.<ref name="":0"" /> Before seeking public office, besides working as a prosecutor, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minnesota law firms [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and [[Gray Plant Mooty]], where she specialized in ""regulatory work in telecommunications law"".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=k000367 | title=Klobuchar, Amy – Biographical Information | website=bioguide.congress.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070201220009/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000367|archive-date=February 1, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/senate/klobuchar/ | title=MPR: Campaign 2006: U.S. Senate: Amy Klobuchar|website=Minnesota Public Radio| language=en | access-date=May 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322122031/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2006/campaign/senate/klobuchar/ | archive-date=March 22, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/02/10/amy-klobuchar-timeline | title = Klobuchar timeline: A life of law and politics led to presidential aspirations|first1=Briana|last1=Bierschbach|first2=Cody|last2=Nelson|first3=Jiwon|last3=Choi|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Her first foray into politics came after she gave birth and was forced to leave the hospital 24 hours later, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail,<ref name="":0"" /> was born with a disorder that prevented her from swallowing. The experience led Klobuchar to appear before the [[Minnesota Legislature|Minnesota State Legislature]], advocating for a bill that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay. Minnesota passed the bill and President Clinton later made the policy federal law.<ref name="":0"" />
 
 Klobuchar was first a candidate for public office in 1994 when she ran for [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] attorney. But she had pledged to drop out if the incumbent, [[Michael O. Freeman|Michael Freeman]], got back in the race after failing to win the endorsement of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party for governor.

 As a congressman, Durbin voted consistently to uphold existing restrictions on abortion or impose new limitations, including supporting a Constitutional amendment that would have nullified ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/Judicial/Durbin/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 4, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913222115/http://www.nrlc.org/Judicial/Durbin/index.html |archivedate=September 13, 2006  }}</ref> He reversed his position in 1989 and has since voted to maintain access to abortion, including support for Medicaid funding of it, and opposition to any limitation he considers a practical or potential encroachment upon ''Roe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massscorecard.org/Social/Richard_Durbin_Abortion.htm |title=Richard Durbin on Abortion |website=Massscorecard.org |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> Durbin has maintained that this reversal came about due to personal reflection and his growing awareness of potentially harmful implications of his previous policy with respect to women facing dangerous pregnancies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/Judicial/Durbin/DurbinMeetPress.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 4, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914032545/http://www.nrlc.org/Judicial/Durbin/DurbinMeetPress.html |archivedate=September 14, 2006  }}</ref> While visiting a home for abused children in [[Quincy, Illinois]], the director, a friend, asked him to speak with two girls who were about to turn 18 and be turned out of state care. Talking with those girls, victims of gang rape and incest, made him reconsider his position on the subject. He says, ""I still oppose abortion and would try my best to convince any woman in my family to carry the baby to term. But I believe that ultimately the decision must be made by the woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience.""<ref name=""tribmag"">{{Cite news|last=Parsons|first=Christi|title=Dick Durbin's Challenge|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|pages=15–19, 26–27|date=December 2, 2007}}</ref>

 === Child care ===
 In 2019, Durbin and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, a bill that created 770,000 new child care jobs and that ensured families under 75 percent of the state median income did not pay for child care with higher-earning families having to pay ""their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have."" The legislation also supported universal access to high-quality preschool programs for all 3 and 4-year-olds and gave the child care workforce a changed compensation and training to aid both teachers and caregivers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/u-s-senator-tammy-baldwin-helps-introduce-legislation-to-ensure-child-care-for-all/|title=U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Helps Introduce Legislation to Ensure Child Care for All|date=March 1, 2019|publisher=urbanmilwaukee.com}}</ref>
 
 === China ===
 In April 2017, Durbin was one of 8 Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on Trump to raise the steel issue with [[President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Xi Jinping]] in his meeting with him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.twincities.com/2017/04/06/klobuchar-franken-among-senators-asking-trump-to-press-china-on-steel/|title=Klobuchar, Franken among senators asking Trump to press China on steel|date=April 6, 2017|first=John|last=Myers|publisher=twincities.com}}</ref>
 
 === Criminal justice reform ===
 In July 2017, along with [[Cory Booker]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], and [[Kamala Harris]], Durbin was one of four senators to introduce the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, legislation implementing a ban on the shackling of pregnant women and mandating the Bureau of Prisons to form superior visitation policies for parents along with providing parenting classes and offering health products such as tampons and pads for free. The bill also restricted prison employees from entering restrooms of the opposite sex with the exception of pressing circumstances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/342506-kamala-harris-slams-sessions-on-criminal-justice|title=Kamala Harris slams Sessions on criminal justice|author=Wheeler, Lydia|date=July 18, 2017|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>",2020-10-12 05:44:50+00:00,12,

 ==Early life, education and career==
 Durbin was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], to an [[Irish-American]] father, William Durbin, and a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]]-born mother, Anna (''née'' Kutkin; Lithuanian: Ona Kutkaitė).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/durbin.htm |title=durbin |website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |date=November 21, 1944 |accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> He graduated from Assumption High School in East St. Louis in 1962. During his high school years he worked at a meatpacking plant. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in 1966. He was an intern in the office of Senator [[Paul Douglas]] of Illinois during his senior year in college. Durbin earned his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in 1969 and was admitted to the Illinois [[bar (law)|bar]] later that year.
 
 After graduating from law school, Durbin started a law practice in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]. He was legal counsel to [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]] from 1969 to 1972, and then legal counsel to the [[Illinois State Senate]] Judiciary Committee from 1972 to 1982. Durbin was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for a seat in the Illinois State Senate in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=26847 |title=Senator Dick Durbin - Biography - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=November 21, 1944 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1978 as the running mate of State Superintendent of Schools [[Michael Bakalis]]. They were defeated by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbents [[James R. Thompson|Jim Thompson]] and [[Dave O'Neal]]. Durbin then worked as an adjunct professor at the [[Southern Illinois University]] School of Medicine for five years while maintaining his law practice.
 
 ===U.S. House of Representatives===
 In 1982, Durbin won the Democratic nomination for the now-eliminated [[Illinois's 20th congressional district|20th congressional district]], which included Macon and most of Springfield. He scored a 1,400 vote victory, defeating 22-year incumbent [[Paul Findley]], a U.S. Navy veteran, whose district lines had been substantially redrawn to remove rural farms and add economically depressed Macon, replacing 35-percent of the voters<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/10/31/the-1982-elections-the-illinois-20th-district-race/76e5660e-4e40-4615-88b0-f012ad57000a/|title=THE 1982 ELECTIONS: THE ILLINOIS 20TH DISTRICT RACE|last=Bohlen|first=Celestine|date=October 31, 1982|work=Washington Post|access-date=July 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1983/ii830218.html|title=redistricting and Reaganomics Feb 1983|website=lib.niu.edu|access-date=July 10, 2018}}</ref> and include more Democrats as part of the [[decennial]] [[redistricting]].  Durbin's campaign emphasized unemployment and financial difficulties facing farmers, and told voters that electing him would send ""a message to Washington and to President Reagan that our economic policies are not working.""

 == Election of 1860 ==
 
 The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the [[American Civil War]].

 == Election of 1860 ==
 
 The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the [[American Civil War]].

 == Election of 1860 ==
 The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the [[American Civil War]].

 Vote allocated by legislature.
 
 ==Elections from 1788-89 to 1856==
 
 In all elections from 1792 to 1860, South Carolina did not conduct a popular vote. Each Elector was appointed by the state legislature.
 
 The election of 1824 was a complex realigning election following the collapse of the prevailing [[Democratic-Republican Party]], resulting in four different candidates each claiming to carry the banner of the party, and competing for influence in different parts of the country. The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes ([[Andrew Jackson]]) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a [[corrupt bargain]].

 The '''Polish Constitutional Court crisis of 2015''' is a political conflict which began in [[Poland]] in October 2015 with the appointment of five [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] judges by the [[Civic Platform]] (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) party. {{As of|2017|12|20}}, the crisis had, according to the [[European Commission]], extended to include ""13 laws affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland"".<ref name=""CE_20171220"" /> The Constitutional Tribunal changes included the replacement of three judges whose terms were not due to expire until after the first possible date of meeting of the new parliament and two judges whose terms were not due to expire until after the last possible date of meeting of the new parliament. According to the Polish law, judges of the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] are to be elected by the parliament which is sitting when the terms of the previous judges expire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm|title=Konstytucja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|website=www.sejm.gov.pl}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}
 
 Civic Platform was predicted to lose the upcoming elections. After the [[Law and Justice]] (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) party won the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]], it made its own appointments to the court, arguing that the previous appointments of the five judges by PO were unconstitutional. In December, PiS changed the court's decision-making power by prescribing a two-thirds majority vote and mandatory participation of at least 13 of the 15 judges on the Constitutional Tribunal. The appointments and amendments caused domestic protests and counter-protests in late December and early January; one of the most significant outcomes was the creation of the [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] protest movement. The law changes were criticized by [[European Commission]] as threatening the rule of law and the human rights of Polish citizens.<ref name=""CE_20171220"" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/01/13/bruxelles-lance-une-enquete-preliminaire-inedite-sur-la-situation-de-l-etat-de-droit-en-pologne_4846618_3214.html|title=Bruxelles lance une enquête préliminaire inédite sur la situation de l'Etat de droit en Pologne|date=2016-01-13|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|issn=1950-6244|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>

+=== Partisan struggle ===
+The [[2015 Polish presidential election|Polish presidential election]], held in May 2015, gave candidate [[Andrzej Duda]], backed by [[Law and Justice]] (PiS), a surprise victory over incumbent President [[Bronisław Komorowski]], backed by the [[Civic Platform]] (PO), which was the then-[[Cabinet of Ewa Kopacz|government]]'s major party. 
+
+President-elect Duda was set to take office in August 2015. Coincidentally, a [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] was also due to be held in October. Opinion polls were now showing that PO was likely to lose to PiS.<ref name=fakt>{{cite web|url=http://www.fakt.pl/politycy/awantura-o-trybunal-konstytucyjny,artykuly,593265.html|title=Awantura o Trybunał Konstytucyjny|date=2015-11-26|work=Fakt.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/ustawa-pis-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym-zaskarzona-do-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego,artykuly,374563,1.html|title=Ustawa PiS o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym zaskarżona do Trybunału Konstytucyjnego|work=Newsweek.pl|date=2015-11-23|language=pl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226170346/http://polska.newsweek.pl/ustawa-pis-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym-zaskarzona-do-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego,artykuly,374563,1.html|archive-date=2015-12-26}}</ref>, meaning PO could lose both government and Presidency to PiS, within five months. 
+
+Judges of the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] are nominated by the [[Sejm|Lower House]], meaning that the partisan influence of the judicial branch was also in play. At the start of the events, 9 of the 15 members had been nominated by PO and its allies during their two terms in government ([[Cabinet of Donald Tusk|Tusk Cabinet]]), while the remaining 6 had been nominated in 2006 and 2007 by PiS and its allies ([[Cabinet of Jarosław Kaczyński|Kaczyński Cabinet]]), and they were the most senior: five of them were due to be replaced in late 2015 (see table).
+
+The Constitution mandates that judges are ""chosen individually by the Sejm for a term of office of 9 years"" (Article 194)<ref name=""pl_konst""/>, but it does not specify what happens when a seat is vacant when the Sejm is itself in recess (during the campaign and before the oaths of office)
+
+The [[List of Sejm members (2011–15)|7th Sejm]]'s session lasted from 8 November 2011 to 11 November 2015, and its last meeting was held on 8–9 October 2015. The election of the [[List of Sejm members (2015–19)|8th Sejm]] was held on 25 October, and the oaths of office were taken starting 12 November.
+
+=== First nominations ===
+On 25 June 2015, the PO government and parliament adopted a new law regarding the constitutional court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fakty.interia.pl/raporty/raport-spor-wokol-tk/komentarze/news-spor-o-tk-katastrofa-europejskiego-projektu-integracyjnego,nId,2212494|title=Spór o TK ""katastrofą europejskiego projektu integracyjnego""?|date=2 June 2016|work=Fakty.Interia.pl}}</ref> Later, the Constitutional Tribunal found this law to be partly unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trybunal.gov.pl/postepowanie-i-orzeczenia/wyroki/art/8748-ustawa-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/|title=Trybunał Konstytucyjny: Ustawa o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym|website=trybunal.gov.pl}}</ref> It was signed by President [[Bronisław Komorowski]] on 21 July 2015 (about one month before end of his presidency).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obserwatorkonstytucyjny.pl/trybunal/prezydent-podpisal-ustawe-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/|title=Prezydent podpisał ustawę o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym|work=Obserwator Konstytucyjny|date=2015-07-22}}</ref>

 ==Election of Constitutional Court judges==
 On 19 November 2015 the new Sejm passed an amendment to the existing law, and mandated the appointment of five new judges, set term limits for the president and vice president of the court, and stipulated term limits for two sitting judges. The president, [[Andrzej Duda]], signed the amendment on 20 November, but the law was challenged at the Constitutional Tribunal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1546853,Prezydent-Andrzej-Duda-podpisal-nowelizacje-ustawy-o-Trybunale-Konstytucyjnym-Wejdzie-w-zycie-5-grudnia |title=Prezydent Andrzej Duda podpisał nowelizację ustawy o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym.

 {{For|related races|1966 United States elections}}
 The '''1966 United States Senate elections''' were elections on November 8, 1966 for the [[United States Senate]] which occurred midway through the second (only full) term of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. With divisions in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] base over the [[Vietnam War]], and with the traditional [[mid-term election|mid-term]] advantage of the party not holding the presidency, the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] took three Democratic seats. Despite Republican gains, the balance remained overwhelmingly in favor of the Democrats, who retained a 64–36 majority.  These were also the first elections held after enactment of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

 Incumbent United States senator [[Lee Metcalf]], who was first elected to the Senate in [[1960 United States Senate election in Montana|1960]], ran for re-election. He won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary uncontested, and moved on to the general election, where he was opposed by [[Tim Babcock]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee and the [[Governor of Montana]]. Though the race remained close, Metcalf was able to expand on his 1960 margin of victory, and defeated Babcock to win a second term.

 Incumbent Senator [[Maurine Brown Neuberger]] did not seek re-election. Held during the escalation of United States involvement of the [[Vietnam War]], the race was between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate and incumbent [[Governor of Oregon]] [[Mark Hatfield]], who opposed the war, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressman [[Robert B. Duncan]], who supported the war. In an unusual move, Oregon's other Senator, Democrat [[Wayne Morse]], who also opposed the war, crossed party lines to endorse Hatfield, who won in a close election, his first of five terms in the United States Senate.
 
-In March 1960, first-term U.S. senator [[Richard L. Neuberger]] died in office. Despite calls to appoint his widow, [[Maurine Brown Neuberger]], to the position, Governor [[Mark Hatfield]] instead appointed [[Oregon Supreme Court]] justice [[Hall S. Lusk]] to fill the position until a [[1960 United States Senate special election in Oregon|November special election]]. Hatfield stated that he intended to have appointed Neuberger, but that he wanted to appoint someone who would be focused on completing the remaining eight months of the term and not running in the [[1960 United States Senate election in Oregon|regular-term Senate election]] as Neuberger had announced she would.<ref name=nyt031660>{{cite news

 {{Main|1966 United States Senate special election in South Carolina}}
 The election resulted from the death of Senator [[Olin D. Johnston]] in 1965. Then-[[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Donald S. Russell]] entered in a prearranged agreement with [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Robert Evander McNair]] in which Russell would resign his post so that he could be appointed Senator. However, former Governor [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]] and went on to beat [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[South Carolina Senate|state senator]] [[Marshall Parker]] in the general election to fill the remaining two years of the unexpired term.
 
 In the [[1962 South Carolina gubernatorial election|1962 gubernatorial election]], [[Donald S. Russell]] had stated that he would he serve out a full term and not seek a higher office. However, midway through his term he resigned from the governorship so that he could be appointed to the [[United States Senate]]. Russell faced a challenge in the Democratic primary from former Governor [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]], who had lost to [[Olin D. Johnston]] in the [[1962 United States Senate election in South Carolina|1962 primary]] for the same Senate seat. On June 14, the [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] held their primary election and Hollings scored a comfortable victory over Russell to become the Democratic nominee.

 Hollings's first Senate victory was also his closest and he was easily re-elected in 1968 (full term), 1974, 1980, and 1986, with somewhat tougher races in 1992 and 1998, although neither with a margin as narrow as that of his initial election. He eventually became seventh longest-serving senator in history (just behind [[Robert Byrd]], Thurmond, [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Carl Hayden]] and [[John C. Stennis]]). He and Thurmond were also the longest-serving Senate duo. Because of this, despite his length of service, Hollings spent 36 years as the junior Senator, even though - with his penultimate term - he had gained seniority of all but four of his colleagues - Byrd, Thurmond, Inouye and Kennedy. Hollings went on to become a nationally important political figure, e.g., serving as Chairman of the Budget committee.

 {{Elections in Maine}}
 The '''2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Maine''' will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the two [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] from the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Maine]], one from each of the state's two [[Maine's congressional districts|congressional districts]]. The elections will coincide with the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential election]], as well as [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2020|other elections]] to the House of Representatives, [[2020 United States Senate elections|elections]] to the [[United States Senate]] and various [[2020 United States elections#State elections|state]] and [[2020 United States elections#Local elections|local elections]].
