Neuberger]] had been diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in 1958 that became terminal by 1960 — but was kept from the public. Neuberger remained at home in early 1960, reportedly battling the flu. Though still publicly seeking re-election, he told his campaign chair, attorney Jack Beatty, \"Remember, there's always another Neuberger,\" referring to his wife. The comment, combined with Neuberger's reluctance to meet in public and weak voice on the phone, led Beatty to believe that Neuberger's condition was grave, a suspicion confirmed by the Senator's physician shortly before Neuberger died at Good Samaritan Hospital on March 9, 1960.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beatty |first=Jack |title=The Politics of Public Virtue |year=2010 |pages=261–268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 10, 1960 |title=Sen.

Johnston]], the incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]], faced stiff competition from [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] who argued that Johnston was too liberal and not representative of South Carolina interests.  Johnston merely told the voters that he was doing what he thought was best for the agriculture and textile workers of the state.  Hollings was decisively defeated by Johnston because Johnston used his position as [[United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Post Office and Civil Service Committee]] to build 40 new post offices in the state and thus demonstrate the pull he had in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to bring home the bacon.\n \n {{Election box begin no change\n- | title= Democratic primary}}\n-{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n-   |party      = Democratic Party (US)\n-   |candidate  = [[Olin D.

Workman tried to persuade the voters that Johnston's policies were socialist and that he was too closely aligned with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration.  Johnston was a consistent supporter of socialized health care proposals and Workman was able to win considerable support from the medical establishment.  However, the state's citizens were much poorer than that of the rest of the nation and Johnston's class based appeals made him a very popular figure for the downtrodden of both the white and black races.  The competitive nature of this race foresaw the eventual rise of the Republican Party and that South Carolinians were growing increasingly suspicious of policies generated at the federal level.\n \n {{Election box begin\n  | title      =South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 1962\n }}\n {{Election box winning candidate with party link\n  | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n  | candidate  = [[Olin D.

After the [[Law and Justice]] (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) party won the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary election]], it made its own appointments to the court, arguing that the previous appointments of the five judges by PO were unconstitutional. In December, PiS changed the court's decision-making power by prescribing a two-thirds majority vote and mandatory participation of at least 13 of the 15 judges on the Constitutional Tribunal. The appointments and amendments caused domestic protests and counter-protests in late December and early January; one of the most significant outcomes was the creation of the [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] protest movement.

Johnson]]. With divisions in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] base over the [[Vietnam War]], and with the traditional [[mid-term election|mid-term]] advantage of the party not holding the presidency, the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] took three Democratic seats. Despite Republican gains, the balance remained overwhelmingly in favor of the Democrats, who retained a 64–36 majority.

He eventually became seventh longest-serving senator in history (just behind [[Robert Byrd]], Thurmond, [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Carl Hayden]] and [[John C. Stennis]]). He and Thurmond were also the longest-serving Senate duo.
