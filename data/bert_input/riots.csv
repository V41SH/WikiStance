 === November 12 lawsuit ===
 On November 12, 2020, Nicole Ziccarelli, a Republican state Senate candidate, sued the Allegheny County Board of Elections in state court. The plaintiff claimed that the board improperly counted 2,349 mail-in ballots that were not dated by the voter, and sought to exclude these votes from being counted. On November 18, 2020, the state's Court of Common Pleas denied the plaintiffs request, ordering the votes to be counted. Ziccarelli appealed the decision on November 19; the following day, the state's Commonwealth Court ruled that the election code requires the voter to date their ballot, and the 2,349 ballots in question should not be counted.<ref name="":672"">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ziccarelli v.

 === November 16 lawsuit ===
 On November 16, 2020, Nicole Ziccarelli, a Republican state Senate candidate, filed a second lawsuit in state court against the Allegheny County Board of Elections. Ziccarelli challenged the decision of the board to count 270 provisional ballots that lacked one of two signatures. The Court of Common Pleas ruled that the ballots should be counted. Ziccarelli appealed; the Commonwealth Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the statute at issue requires both signatures and the ballots should not be counted. On November 23, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the board's petition for appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ziccarelli v.

 On December 12, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge [[Brett H. Ludwig|Brett Ludwig]] dismissed the case with prejudice. Judge Ludwig described the case as ""''extraordinary''"" with ""even more ''extraordinary''"" relief sought. The judge ruled that the Trump campaign's ""Electors Clause claims fail as a matter of law and fact"" and that the opposite was proven: Wisconsin's presidential electors were determined exactly in the way the Wisconsin legislature intended, because the Wisconsin legislature had ordered the Wisconsin Election Commission to decide the rules of the election. The judge also noted that since the lawsuit was about ""disputed issues of election administration"" practices, Trump could have filed the lawsuit before the vote occurred, but failed to do so.

 == ''Wisconsin Voters Alliance v. Wisconsin Elections Commission'' ==
 On November 23, 2020, a group of Republican voters, the Wisconsin Voters Alliance, filed a lawsuit in the Wisconsin Supreme Court against the [[Wisconsin Elections Commission]]. The voters claimed that a [[Mark Zuckerberg]]-funded organization, Center for Technology and Civic Life, gave $6 million to the cities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[Milwaukee]] in order to facilitate the casting of tens of thousands of illegal ballots. The group said Trump would have won the state without the inclusion of those ballots; as a remedy, they asked the court to stop the certification of the election, allow the state legislature to appoint electors, and order the governor to certify those electors. Democratic Attorney General [[Josh Kaul]] released a statement the following day, saying the litigation seeks to disenfranchise voters, and that his department ""will ensure that Wisconsin's presidential electors are selected based on the will of the more than 3 million Wisconsin voters who cast a ballot.""<ref name="":7"">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Wisconsin Voters Alliance vs. Wisconsin Election Commissions|url=https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=393|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129201501/https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=393|archive-date=November 29, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project}}</ref><ref name="":11"">{{Cite web|last1=Tornabene|first1=Juliana|last2=Baik|first2=Michelle|date=November 24, 2020|title=Group asks state high court to toss election results and order legislature to pick electors|url=https://www.nbc15.com/2020/11/24/voter-group-files-lawsuit-against-the-wisconsin-elections-commission-over-election-results/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124223144/https://www.nbc15.com/2020/11/24/voter-group-files-lawsuit-against-the-wisconsin-elections-commission-over-election-results/|archive-date=November 24, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=nbc15.com|language=en|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name="":12"">{{Cite web|last=Bauer|first=Scott|date=November 24, 2020|title=Republicans sue to stop Wisconsin vote certification|url=https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-madison-wisconsin-7882adcf4ed8fc941fa6948e1da9e5ab|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128032408/https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-madison-wisconsin-7882adcf4ed8fc941fa6948e1da9e5ab|archive-date=November 28, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=AP NEWS}}</ref> On December 4, the court rejected the petition, with Justice Brian Hagedorn writing: ""Once the door is opened to judicial invalidation of presidential election results, it will be awfully hard to close that door again.

 Palazzo entered the Republican primary for [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]] and won the nomination with 57% of the vote. He faced 10-term Democratic incumbent [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] in the general election. Although the 4th district had turned almost solidly Republican at the federal level, Taylor held the seat without serious difficulty from 1996 onward. His voting record had been very conservative even by [[Mississippi Democratic Party|Mississippi Democratic]] standards, and he'd often broken with his party. Palazzo established himself as Taylor's strongest opponent since 1996. In particular, he attacked Taylor for supporting [[Nancy Pelosi]] for House Speaker in 2006 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/44119.html|title=Taylor: I voted for McCain – Jessica Taylor|publisher=Politico.Com|access-date=2010-11-03}}</ref> He was endorsed by [[Sarah Palin]] and in the November 2010 general election, Palazzo defeated Taylor 52%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=496790 |title=MS – District 04 Race – Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |access-date=2015-03-14}}</ref>
