 === November 12 lawsuit ===
 On November 12, 2020, Nicole Ziccarelli, a Republican state Senate candidate, sued the Allegheny County Board of Elections in state court. The plaintiff claimed that the board improperly counted 2,349 mail-in ballots that were not dated by the voter, and sought to exclude these votes from being counted. On November 18, 2020, the state's Court of Common Pleas denied the plaintiffs request, ordering the votes to be counted. Ziccarelli appealed the decision on November 19; the following day, the state's Commonwealth Court ruled that the election code requires the voter to date their ballot, and the 2,349 ballots in question should not be counted.<ref name="":672"">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ziccarelli v.

 == ''Wisconsin Voters Alliance v. Wisconsin Elections Commission'' ==
 On November 23, 2020, a group of Republican voters, the Wisconsin Voters Alliance, filed a lawsuit in the Wisconsin Supreme Court against the [[Wisconsin Elections Commission]]. The voters claimed that a [[Mark Zuckerberg]]-funded organization, Center for Technology and Civic Life, gave $6 million to the cities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[Milwaukee]] in order to facilitate the casting of tens of thousands of illegal ballots. The group said Trump would have won the state without the inclusion of those ballots; as a remedy, they asked the court to stop the certification of the election, allow the state legislature to appoint electors, and order the governor to certify those electors.

He was first elected to office in 1954, when he won election to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]]; in 1958, he was elected Speaker, the youngest person to hold that office in the state's history. In 1962, he ran for the U.S. Senate, narrowly defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Homer E. Capehart]]. Shortly after entering the Senate, he became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution|Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments]], and in that role authored two constitutional amendments: the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-fifth]]—which establishes procedures for an [[Peaceful transition of power|orderly transition of power]] in the case of the death, disability, or resignation of the [[President of the United States]]—and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-sixth]], which lowered the voting age to 18 throughout the United States. He is the only non–[[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to have authored two constitutional amendments. Bayh also led unsuccessful efforts to ratify the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and eliminate the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].
 
 Bayh authored [[Title IX]] of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], which bans [[gender discrimination]] in higher education institutions that receive federal funding. He also authored the [[Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act]], and co-authored the [[Bayh–Dole Act]], which deals with intellectual property that arises from federal-government-funded research.

Bayh intended to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, but declined to run after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, but dropped out of the campaign after disappointing finishes in the first set of primaries and caucuses.
 
-Bayh won re-election in 1968 and 1974, but lost his 1980 bid for a fourth term to [[Dan Quayle]]. After leaving the Senate, he remained active in the political and legal world.

His ancestry included German, English, [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], and Scottish. Bayh spent summers on his grandparents' farm in [[Shirkieville, Indiana]], where he later lived. As a student at New Goshen (Fayette Township) High School, young Birch took part in speaking contests, played baseball and basketball, and won the Indiana [[4-H]] Tomato Championship.<ref name=""Cruikshank"">Cruikshank, Kate.

 === Indiana legislature and 1962 U.S. Senate campaign ===
 [[File:Birch and Evan Bayh 1962.jpg|thumb|Bayh with son Evan Bayh, wife Marvella and an unidentified woman, 1962.]]
 Bayh's political career began at age 26 with his election to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] in 1954, where he served two years as Speaker and four years as Democratic [[Floor Leader]]. At the time, Bayh was the youngest Speaker in Indiana state history.<ref name=""Household"" /> While he served in the legislature, Bayh studied law at [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law|Indiana University's School of Law]], received his [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] in 1960, and was admitted to the Indiana Bar in 1961.<ref name=""Biography"">{{cite web |url=http://www.birchbayh.com/id1.html |title=Biography |website=www.birchbayh.com}}</ref>
 
 At age 34, Bayh was elected to the United States Senate in the [[1962 United States Senate elections|1962 midterm elections]], defeating 18-year incumbent [[Homer E. Capehart]]. Capehart was outspoken on the threat of Soviet nuclear missiles being placed in [[Cuba]], and was buoyed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of that October. Bayh's disadvantage was dramatized in the opening scene of the 2000 film [[Thirteen Days (film)|''Thirteen Days'']], as President [[John F. Kennedy]] rattles a newspaper and asks an aide, ""You see this goddamn Capehart stuff?"" and the aide responds, ""Bayh's going to lose.""<ref>{{cite web |last=Self |first=David |title=13 Days script by David Self |url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/13_days.html |publisher=The Daily Script|access-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>
 
 Bayh's success was attributed to a vigorous campaign of 300 speeches between [[Labor Day]] and the election,<ref name=""Cruikshank"" /> and a catchy campaign jingle that taught voters the correct pronunciation of his last name:<ref name="":4"" />

 [[File:Birch and Evan Bayh 1962.jpg|thumb|Bayh with son Evan Bayh, wife Marvella and an unidentified woman, 1962.]]
 Bayh's political career began at age 26 with his election to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] in 1954, where he served two years as Speaker and four years as Democratic [[Floor Leader]]. At the time, Bayh was the youngest Speaker in Indiana state history.<ref name=""Household"" /> While he served in the legislature, Bayh studied law at [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law|Indiana University's School of Law]], received his [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] in 1960, and was admitted to the Indiana Bar in 1961.<ref name=""Biography"">{{cite web |url=http://www.birchbayh.com/id1.html |title=Biography |website=www.birchbayh.com}}</ref>
 
 At age 34, Bayh was elected to the United States Senate in the [[1962 United States Senate elections|1962 midterm elections]], defeating 18-year incumbent [[Homer E. Capehart]]. Capehart was outspoken on the threat of Soviet nuclear missiles being placed in [[Cuba]], and was buoyed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of that October. Bayh's disadvantage was dramatized in the opening scene of the 2000 film [[Thirteen Days (film)|''Thirteen Days'']], as President [[John F.
