 '''Gordon Douglas Jones''' (born May 4, 1954) is an American attorney, former prosecutor and politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Alabama]] since 2018. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|Northern District of Alabama]] from 1997 to 2001.
 
 Jones was born in [[Fairfield, Alabama]], and is a graduate of the [[University of Alabama]] and [[Cumberland School of Law]] at [[Samford University]]. After law school, he worked as a congressional staffer and as a federal prosecutor before moving to private practice. In 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Jones as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Jones's most prominent cases were the successful prosecution of two [[Ku Klux Klan]] members for the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|1963 Birmingham church bombing]] that killed four African-American girls and the indictment of domestic terrorist [[Eric Rudolph]]. He returned to private practice at the conclusion of Clinton's presidency in 2001.
 
 Jones announced his candidacy for United States Senate in the [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|2017 special election]] following the resignation of Republican incumbent [[Jeff Sessions]] to become [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]]. After winning the Democratic primary in August, he faced former [[Supreme Court of Alabama|Alabama Supreme Court]] Justice [[Roy Moore]] in the general election. Jones was considered a long-shot candidate in a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|deeply Republican state]]. A month before the election, Moore was [[Roy Moore sexual misconduct allegations|alleged]] to have sexually assaulted and otherwise acted inappropriately with several females, including some who were minors at the time.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/roy-moore-loses-alabama-senate-race-doug-jones-wins|title=Alabama election: Democrats triumph over Roy Moore in major blow to Trump |last1=Jacobs |first1=Ben |last2=Smith |first2=David |date=December 13, 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> Jones won the special election by 22,000 votes, 50%–48%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/turbulent-senate-race-now-hands-alabama-voters-51733556 |title=Democrat Jones wins stunning red-state Alabama Senate upset |author1=Chandler, Kim |date=December 13, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |agency=Associated Press |author2=Peoples, Steve |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217005217/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/turbulent-senate-race-now-hands-alabama-voters-51733556 |archive-date=December 17, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
 
 Jones is currently the only statewide elected Democrat in Alabama and the first Democrat to win statewide office since [[Lucy Baxley]] was elected President of the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]] in 2008.

 ===16th Street Baptist Church bombing case===
 [[File:Doug Jones Cherry Trial (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|Jones during the trial of Bobby Frank Cherry]]
 Jones prosecuted [[Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr.]] and [[Bobby Frank Cherry]], two members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], for their roles in the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]]. The case was reopened the year before Jones was appointed, but did not gain traction until his appointment. A [[federal grand jury]] was called in 1998, which caught the attention of Cherry's ex-wife, Willadean Cherry, and led her to call the FBI to give her testimony. Willadean then introduced Jones to family and friends, who reported their own experiences from the time of the bombing. A key piece of evidence was a tape from the time of the bombing in which Blanton said he had plotted with others to make the bomb. Jones was deputized to argue in state court and indicted Blanton and Cherry in 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/us/church-bombing-trial-begins-birmingham-city-s-past-very-much-present.html|title=As Church Bombing Trial Begins in Birmingham, the City's Past Is Very Much Present|last=Sack|first=Kevin|date=April 25, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/14/nation/la-na-nn-birmingham-bombing-prosecutor-20130913|title=Prosecutor reflects on 50th anniversary of 1963 Birmingham bombing|last=Hennessy-Fiske|first=Molly|date=September 14, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> Blanton was found guilty in 2001 and Cherry in 2002.

 ===Abortion===
 In 2017, Bullock vetoed measures to outlaw [[abortion]]s after 20 weeks, citing constitutional rulings on the women's ability to protect their lives and health and arguing that elected officials should not put personal beliefs above medical professionals' judgment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortion, guns, state plane among bills vetoed by governor |url=https://apnews.com/article/3cd844d6f8f643c897d132c930f19379 |website=[[Associated Press]] |date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Governor Bullock Stands With Montana Families By Vetoing Extreme Bills Endangering Women|url=https://www.aclumontana.org/en/press-releases/governor-bullock-stands-montana-families-vetoing-extreme-bills-endangering-women|website=American Civil Liberties Union of Montana|accessdate=July 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702093732/https://www.aclumontana.org/en/press-releases/governor-bullock-stands-montana-families-vetoing-extreme-bills-endangering-women|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He has said that he personally believes life begins at [[Fetal viability|viability]] but that ""it's not up to people like me to be making these decisions"".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frazin |first1=Rachel |title=2020 Dem Steve Bullock: I think life begins at viability |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/444444-bullock-i-think-life-begins-at-viability |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |language=en |date=19 May 2019}}</ref> In 2018, Bullock wrote a letter to [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Alex Azar]] requesting that [[Title X]] funding for reproductive health care and [[family planning]] for low-income women remain in effect, saying the program had generated more than $29 million in savings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drake |first1=Phil |title=Bullock repeats opposition to family planning changes |url=https://eu.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/08/03/montana-governor-opposes-trumps-family-planning-changes/900103002/ |website=[[Great Falls Tribune]] |date=August 3, 2018}}</ref>
 
 ===Campaign finance reform===
 As Attorney General of Montana, Bullock advocated on behalf of the state's century-old ban on corporate money in elections, the Montana Corrupt Practices Act of 1912. After that and similar laws were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court's ''[[Citizens United]]'' decision in 2010, Bullock countered with a new case, ''American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock'' (2012). The Supreme Court disposed of the case in a 5–4 decision,<ref>{{cite web |title=AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC. v.

 === Campaign ===
 After one term in the House representing [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]] counties, Huffington spent $8 million by the end of August and a total of $28 million during the entire campaign. He became wealthy off oil and gas. The race saw personal attacks on Huffington's wife, [[Arianna Huffington]], who was very involved in the race (the media dubbed her the ""Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing,"" according to ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'').
 
 Huffington was called a hypocrite for supporting [[Proposition 187]] and then breaking the law for employing illegal aliens, a story which came out in the race's final days.<ref>{{cite news |author=B.

 === Results ===
 On election day it was a very close race, but Feinstein won Los Angeles County, which may have pulled her ahead. Her sizable win in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area may also be credited to her slim statewide victory. A large number of absentee ballots left the results in doubt for over two weeks. On November 18, Senator Feinstein declared victory. At that time, she was ahead by 147,404 votes, with only 156,210 remaining uncounted ballots.<ref name=""Feinstein declared victory"">{{cite news |author=B.
