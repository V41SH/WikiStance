Ziccarelli challenged the decision of the board to count 270 provisional ballots that lacked one of two signatures. The Court of Common Pleas ruled that the ballots should be counted. Ziccarelli appealed; the Commonwealth Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the statute at issue requires both signatures and the ballots should not be counted. On November 23, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the board's petition for appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ziccarelli v.

The voters claimed that a [[Mark Zuckerberg]]-funded organization, Center for Technology and Civic Life, gave $6 million to the cities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[Milwaukee]] in order to facilitate the casting of tens of thousands of illegal ballots. The group said Trump would have won the state without the inclusion of those ballots; as a remedy, they asked the court to stop the certification of the election, allow the state legislature to appoint electors, and order the governor to certify those electors. Democratic Attorney General [[Josh Kaul]] released a statement the following day, saying the litigation seeks to disenfranchise voters, and that his department \"will ensure that Wisconsin's presidential electors are selected based on the will of the more than 3 million Wisconsin voters who cast a ballot.\"<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Wisconsin Voters Alliance vs. Wisconsin Election Commissions|url=https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=393|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129201501/https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=393|archive-date=November 29, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|last1=Tornabene|first1=Juliana|last2=Baik|first2=Michelle|date=November 24, 2020|title=Group asks state high court to toss election results and order legislature to pick electors|url=https://www.nbc15.com/2020/11/24/voter-group-files-lawsuit-against-the-wisconsin-elections-commission-over-election-results/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124223144/https://www.nbc15.com/2020/11/24/voter-group-files-lawsuit-against-the-wisconsin-elections-commission-over-election-results/|archive-date=November 24, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=nbc15.com|language=en|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|last=Bauer|first=Scott|date=November 24, 2020|title=Republicans sue to stop Wisconsin vote certification|url=https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-madison-wisconsin-7882adcf4ed8fc941fa6948e1da9e5ab|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128032408/https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-madison-wisconsin-7882adcf4ed8fc941fa6948e1da9e5ab|archive-date=November 28, 2020|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=AP NEWS}}</ref> On December 4, the court rejected the petition, with Justice Brian Hagedorn writing: \"Once the door is opened to judicial invalidation of presidential election results, it will be awfully hard to close that door again.
