      "Peterson had long fended off various Republican challengers during his tenure in Congress, but his district had grown increasingly more conservative during that timeframe. As the national Democratic Party had moved far to Peterson's left on social issues, his constituents became even less interested in the party; for example, Peterson had outrun the Democratic presidential nominee in each election since 2000 (the Republican candidate had won his district each time, often with widening margins except [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, who only lost 50-47).",
      "",
      "However, the rise of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential bid, his presidency, and his intense popularity in rural America had led Peterson to become more vulnerable as Trump concurrently fueled rural ire against the Democratic Party, including the DFL. As a result of this, Peterson would finally be defeated by a Republican, [[Michelle Fischbach]], in the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota#District 7|2020 election]]."
