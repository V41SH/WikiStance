      "The above paragraph, and assertion of conspiracy theory, is directly contradicted by the [https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf Department of Justice's Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation] report published in December 2019. Among the findings from the DOJ, \"the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane on July 31, 2016, just days after its receipt of information from a FFG reporting that, in May 2016, during a meeting with the FFG, then-Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos 'suggested the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clinton (and President Obama)... We did not find information in FBI or Department ECs, emails or other documents, or through witness testimony, indicating that any information other than the FFG information was relied upon to predicate the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.\"",
