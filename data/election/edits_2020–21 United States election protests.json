      "",
      "The weekend after the election, Infowars host Alex Jones, along with crew members Owen Shroyer and Ali Alexander, announced they would send a caravan of vehicles from Austin, TX to Washington D.C. starting the next day to rally support for Donald Trump (https://parler.com/post/4e08833557c6497c839511f82f4dfeb9). Infowars contributor Ali Alexander suggested / started the hashtag #marchfortrump, and announced a march for Trump in Washington D.C., scheduled for Saturday, November 14.  The march was not anticipated to be massive at that time.  Infowars publicized the event for the first time on Sunday, 11/8/2020.  The next day, upon hearing about the ‘Stop the Steal Caravan’ and the ‘March For Trump,’ alt-pop musician Adam Metropolis started the hashtag #millionMAGAmarch on Parler, and began making promo images & videos for that concept.  Metropolis did this completely independently, having no relationship with Infowars.  The origin of the name ‘Million MAGA March’ was on Monday, 11/9 (https://parler.com/post/07bc7707d42a4f5397dc4ae1d2afecaf).",
      "The concept was, according to Adam, to create a manipulative title that would encourage Trump-supporters to think the turn-out was going to be good, so they would be more likely to go.  It was also to anger media outlets to increase coverage.",
      "Adam pushed promos on the social media platforms Parler, Minds, MeWe, and Gab. Harrison Smith, an Infowars anchor, saw the hashtag and began using the term “Million MAGA March” live on air during Infowars’ “The War Room” on Monday, 11/9. At this time there was still no time or location set for the so-called ‘Million MAGA March.’   The next day, the Proud Boys had announced “The Million MAGA March” publicly, and the event spread virally on Parler & Minds.",
      "Adam Metropolis contacted news sources in the US and internationally, giving a news tip about a horrible Trump rally where there would be no masks or social distancing.  He did this under ghe pseudonym ‘Calvin Ennis.’  (All outgoing emails can be forwarded for historical record.)",

      "Soon, viral content was promoting “Global Protests” (https://parler.com/post/186071c90bb944bea625ed01ed62f125 ) and called for people around the world to rise up against COVID19 lockdowns.  The event was seen as a revolt against global government, not merely a rally event for Trump.",
