      "Sectarianism was relatively low compared to periods of the Ottoman Empire and what is seen from Turkey in the 1980s. President İnönü was a hardline Kemalist who wanted to continue the policy of Ataturk. This meant religious freedom was guaranteed to all Turkish citizens. As such, Alevis, Christians and Jews lived in harmony with the Sunni majority, unlike anything that was seen before. Ataturk demanded national unity and İnönü would continue to fight for it even after losing power."
