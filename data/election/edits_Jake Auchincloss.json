      "{{AFC comment|1=Auchincloss is not yet a Congressman-elect.  He has not been elected in the November general election.  He therefore does not yet satisfy [[WP:NPOL|political notability]].  It is true but irrelevant that he is in a safe Democratic district.  He has not been elected.  It is also the practice in Wikipedia that candidates for political office are very seldom considered to pass [[WP:GNG|general notability]] due to campaign publicity, and the significant coverage of Auchincloss has all been campaign-related.  So he does not pass [[WP:NPOL|political notability]] or [[WP:GNG|general notability]].",
