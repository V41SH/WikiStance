      "There are still several states that have not finished the vote count and no state has certified their vote count. A software glitch has been found in one county that resulted in a 6,000 vote error. That same software was used in many of the swing states and over 700 counties. On election night an election official accidently added a 0 to a 10,000 tally.  While the press can report anything they like they can not officially declare a winner only the United States Congress can do that. A Joint Session of Congress meets to Count Electoral Votes and Declare Election Results Meets On January 6. Until this happens there is no official winner only what some believe to be a likely outcome.{{short description|59th United States presidential inauguration}}"
