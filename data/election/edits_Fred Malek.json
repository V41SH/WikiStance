      "In August 1959, Malek and four other men were arrested in Vicary's Park near [[Peoria, Illinois]] after a dog was killed, eviscerated and barbecued on a spit. Charges of cruelty to animals were later dismissed against all but one of the men, Andrew P. O'Meara, who testified that he alone had struck and killed the dog, skinned it and tried to cook it, in order to teach the others something about living off the land.<ref name=\"bbq\" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Luciano |first1=Phil |title=New political probe pales next to long-ago dog barbecue |url=https://www.eveningtribune.com/article/20080213/NEWS/302139938 |newspaper=[[The Evening Tribune (Hornell)|The Evening Tribune]] |accessdate=11 August 2020 |date=2008-02-13 |location=[[Hornell, New York]]}}</ref>",
