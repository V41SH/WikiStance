      "This was one of many states where a RIGGED ELECTION took place. The crooked Democrat party machine in Detroit manufactured illegal Democrat votes, threw out legal poll watchers, and were mired in many more irregularities than usual. This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Michigan, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Michigan Legislature, President Trump WON Michigan’s Electoral College votes and a second term."
