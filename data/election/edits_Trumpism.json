      "Journalist Elaina Plott suggests ideology is not as important as other characteristics of Trumpism.{{#tag:ref|Plott covers the Republican Party and conservatism  as a national political reporter for The New York Times. In her in-depth article on how Donald Trump has remade the Republican Party, Plott interviewed 30 or so Republican officials.|group=Note}}  She cites one political analysist (Jeff Roe) noting Trump \"understood\" and acted on the trend among Republican voters to be \"less ideological\" but \"more polarized\". Republicans are now more willing to accept policies like government mandated health care coverage for pre-existing conditions or trade tariffs, formerly considered burdensome government regulations by conservatives. At the same time strong avowals of support for Trump and aggressive partisanship have become part of Republican election campaigning in at least some parts of America, reaching down even to formerly collegial, issue-driven, non-partisan campaigns for local government.<ref name=\"Plott-27-10-2020\">{{cite news |last1=Plott |first1=Elaina |title=Win or Lose, It’s Donald Trump’s Republican Party |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/magazine/trump-influence-gop.html |accessdate=29 October 2020 |agency=New York Times |date=27 October 2020}}</ref> Research by political scientist [[Marc Hetherington]] and others has found Trump supporters tend to share a \"worldview\" transcending political ideology, agreeing with statements like \"the best strategy is to play hardball, even if it means being unfair\". In contrast, those  who agree with statements like “cooperation is the key to success” tend to prefer (Trump adversary) [[Mitt Romney]].<ref name=\"Plott-27-10-2020\"/>"
