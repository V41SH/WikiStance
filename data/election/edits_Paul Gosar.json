      "In 2020, Gosar joined fellow congressmember [[Andy Biggs]] in a video produced by the [[Arizona Republican Party]] claiming that there was [[2020_United_States_presidential_election#Trump's_potential_rejection_of_election_results|widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election]] in which Joe Biden was declared the winner. Gosar claimed voting machines were faulty in Arizona and that Wisconsin intentionally paused counting votes to \"dump\" 100,000 votes into the count for Joe Biden. Gosar also claims that deceased people voted in Pennsylvania. All of Gosar's allegations have been debunked. Gosar and Biggs also demanded an audit of Maricopa County's vote count.<ref name=\"Hansen\">{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Ronald J. |title=FACT CHECK: Reps.
