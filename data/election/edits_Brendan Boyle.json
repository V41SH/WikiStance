      "As a Democratic Congressman and due to his roots as the son of an Irish immigrant, Brendan Boyle is a keen supporter of the Good Friday Peace Agreement and in November 2020 declared his support for the continuity of the agreement above all else. Whilst his principles were judged to be highly sound, the methods he used to achieve this were deemed somewhat questionable since Boyle used the leverage of a potential free trade agreement with the United States to encourage Great Britain to water down 'Brexit' (Britain's exit from the EU) in effect reinstating all clauses of the withdrawal agreement which rendered Britain under European control to a large extent. When this information came to public knowledge this unfortunately caused a degree of outrage amongst the people in Great Britain, who judged that this stance did not allow them to become a sovereign nation once again. More significantly this stance caused some damage to the decades old 'special relationship' between the US and Great Britain in the process. Despite his threat, there remained major support for the (* yet to be declared) Democratic 'President Elect' Joe Biden in Great Britain at the time, due to widespread knowledge of his assistance during the Falklands war almost 40 years earlier.",
