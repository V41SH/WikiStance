      "Continuing the tradition of his mentor [[John C. Calhoun]], whose last speech Mason read to the Senate when Calhlun was too sick to do so himself, Mason strongly believed states had the right to secede. Furthermore, the North's intolerance of their \"[[peculiar institution]]\", their \"property rights\" (the right to own human beings), the North was leaving them no other choice. He said he didn't need reasons to leave the Union, he needed a reason to stay in the Union.<ref name=Young/>{{rp|101}}"
