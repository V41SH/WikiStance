      "Trump is also a notorious cheater. According to [[Sports Illustrated]] columnist [[Rick Reilly]]'s book, ''Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump'', \"Trump doesn’t just cheat at golf. He cheats like a three-card Monte dealer. He throws it, boots it, and moves it. He lies about his lies. He fudges and foozles and fluffs. At Winged Foot, where Trump is a member, the caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him: “Pele.” \"."
