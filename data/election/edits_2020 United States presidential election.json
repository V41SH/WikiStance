      "Polls showed that 58% to 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island voters (AAPI voters) supported Biden-Harris while 28% to 40% supported Trump-Pence. “From all of the data that we’ve seen, it’s safe to say Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump ... backing Democrats at a roughly 2:1 ratio,” says [[Karthick Ramakrishnan]], a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data. However, this overall tendency overlooks differences among particular ethnic groups: [[Korean Americans]], [[Japanese Americans]], [[Indian Americans]], and [[Chinese Americans]] favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to groups including [[Vietnamese Americans]] and [[Filipino Americans]]. Many voters were turned off by Trump's racist language (“China virus” and “kung flu”), but others appreciated his strong anti-China, anti-imperialist stance. Many Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric and support of Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zhou |first1=Li |title=What we know about who Asian American voters supported in the election |url=https://www.vox.com/21561408/asian-american-voters-presidential-election |website=[[Vox (website)]] |access-date=November 22, 2020 |language=en |date=14 November 2020 |quote=With strong turnout this year and more voters joining the electorate, it’s evident that AAPI voters are a key base that can’t be neglected.
