When he first considered running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2011, Trump drew attention for his promotion of the \"[[Birther conspiracy|birther]]\" theory, according to which  President Obama was born in Kenya and ineligible to be president. Following his defeat in his 2020 re-election bid, Trump has promoted conspiracy theories about the election having been rigged against him. Trump has also repeatedly refused to denounce the [[Q Anon|q-anon]] conspiracy theory, according to which leading Democrats are involved in the sex-trafficking and cannibalism of children.<ref>https://apnews.com/article/e230131513bf3df60c76bb1151bc6b7c</ref>"
