Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference).",
