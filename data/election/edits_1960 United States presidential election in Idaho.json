      "Nixon won Idaho by 22,744 votes, or 7.6%, which was significantly less then fellow Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[1956 United States presidential election in Idaho|1956]], who won the state by a margin of 22.4%, or 61,111 votes. 4 years later, Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] would win the state by a margin of 1.83%, or 5,363 votes, which as of the [[2020 United States presidential election in Idaho|2020 Presidential Election]], is the last time a Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state, or even broke 40% of the total vote. Excluding Johnson's win in [[1964 United States presidential election in Idaho|1964]], as of the [[2020 United States presidential election in Idaho|2020 Presidential Election]], this is the last time a Democratic Presidential candidate got even remotely close to winning the state, as all subsequent elections after [[1964 United States presidential election in Idaho|1964]] have gone to the Republican candidate by double digits."
