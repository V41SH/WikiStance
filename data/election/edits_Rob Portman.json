      "During his tenure in [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]], Portman authored or co-authored over a dozen bills that became law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400325|title=Robert Portman, former U.S. Representative|publisher=GovTrack.us|accessdate=August 21, 2010}}</ref> including legislation to [[Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998|reform the Internal Revenue Service]], curb [[unfunded mandates]], and expand [[pensions]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s104-1 Senate 1: Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995], ''GovTrack.us''.

Retrieved April 11, 2012.</ref> He published an article called \"Addicted to Failure\" in the congressional ''Policy Review'' in autumn 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/bibdisplay.pl?index=p000449|title=Addicted to Failure |publisher=Policy Review, 79|date=Septemberâ€“October 1996|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref> In the article, Portman writes: {{cquote| President Clinton hurt the antidrug effort by cutting the Office of National Drug Control policy from 147 to 25 full-time positions, by hiring a [[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general]] who advocated legalization of drugs, by cutting funding for interdiction efforts, and by sending confusing messages about the stigma of illegal drug use. It is no surprise, then, that after dramatic reductions in drug use during the decade before Clinton took office, drug use has nearly doubled among teenagers during his [[Clinton Administration|administration]]. ... The public rightly expects the federal government to do something about drug abuse, which diminishes and threatens the lives of so many of our young people. And the federal government clearly has an important role in combating drug abuse: protecting our borders and interdicting drugs from other countries, strengthening our federal criminal-justice system, and providing federal assistance for the best prevention and treatment programs. ... Despite a significant federal effort, however, our country is still seeing dramatic increases in drug use among our teenagers. In the last two years alone, use of drugs has increased 50 percent. We need a new approach.<ref name=\"Portman\">{{cite news |last=Portman|first=Rob |title=Addicted to Failure |url= http://www.unz.org/Pub/PolicyRev-1996sep-00056 |date=September 1996|work=Policy Review |accessdate=April 1, 2013 }}</ref>}}"
