Hayes]] faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]].  It was one of the most contentious and controversial [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] in American history, and gave rise to the [[Compromise of 1877]] by which the Democrats conceded the election to Hayes in return for an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.

      "After President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] declined to seek a third term despite previously being expected to do so, Congressman [[James G. Blaine]] emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. However, Blaine was unable to win a majority at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]], which settled on Governor Hayes of Ohio as a compromise candidate. The [[1876 Democratic National Convention]] nominated Governor Tilden of New York on the second ballot.",

      "The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, after a first count of votes, Tilden had won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes's 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved: in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon, one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for being an \"elected or appointed official\". The question of who should have been awarded these electoral votes is the source of the continued controversy.",

The Compromise in effect ceded power in the Southern states to the Democratic [[Redeemers]], who proceeded to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise black voters]] thereafter.",
