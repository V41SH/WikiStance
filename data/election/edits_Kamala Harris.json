      "On November 7, 2020, ''[[CBC News]]'' interviewed Wanda Kagan, a high school friend of Kamala.<ref name=Cbc2020-11-07/>  She described Kamala as her best friend, and described how she confided in her that she was being molested by her stepfather.  She said that Kamala told her mother who then insisted she come to live with them, for the remainder of her final year of high school.  She said Kamala had recently told her that their friendship, and playing a role in countering Wanda's exploitation, helped form the commitment she felt in protecting women and children, when she was a prosecutor."
