      "The election was not close with Hickenlooper winning by 9.3%, with still 3% left to be counted. Hickenlooper's win was expected, as [[Colorado]] has moved more toward being a blue state. Key to Hickenlooper's victory was [[Denver County]] home of [[Denver]], and [[Denver]]'s suburban counties, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, and Jefferson. Gardner did do well in the typically red [[El Paso County]] home of [[Colorado Springs]]. Gardner also did well in many rural areas of the state. However, Hickenlooper's strong performance in heavily populated counties proved too much for Gardner to overcome. Hickenlooper was also likely helped by now President-Elect [[Joseph R. Biden]] who won the Centennial State by 13.5%. Hickenlooper will be the first senator from [[Colorado]] who was also the [[Governor of Colorado]] since Senator [[Edwin Johnson]] was elected in 1936. Senator-Elect Hickenlooper will be sworn in on January 3, 2021 for a six year term that expires on January 3, 2027."
