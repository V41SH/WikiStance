      "Upon her 2020 election victory to represent [[New York's 11th congressional district|New York's 11th district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Nicole Malliotakis indicated an intent to form a [[conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] “Freedom Squad” in Congress as a counterweight to oppose the so-called “[[The Squad (United States Congress)|Squad]]” of self-identified “[[socialist]]”-leaning [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] led by fellow New York Rep. [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]. “We need someone who is going to be a counterbalance to AOC. We need to form our own ‘squad.’ We have a group of new Republicans who love America. We value freedom, liberty and opportunity,” Malliotakis said, referencing several other newly elected members of Congress whose families escaped from [[Communist]] regimes—like her own mother fled [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]]—inspiring personal antipathy to the extreme [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] “socialist”  agenda of Ocasio-Cortez. “Freedom for a strong economy. Less government. That’s why our families fled oppressive regimes. Our families fled from oppressive countries with the very same policies that AOC and the Squad are promoting,” Malliotakis went on, firing a broadside against the controversial far-left celebrity congresswomen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/11/13/nicole-malliotakis-forming-freedom-squad-to-counter-aoc-crew/|title=Rep-elect Nicole Malliotakis forming ‘Freedom Squad’ to counter AOC crew|first=Carl|last=Campanile|date=November 13, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=November 13, 2020}}</ref>"
