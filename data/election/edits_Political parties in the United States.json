      "American electoral politics has been dominated by two major [[political parties]] since shortly after the founding of the republic. Since the 1850s, they have been the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party ]] and the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Since the last major party realignment in the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party has been the [[center-left]] and [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] party, and the Republican Party has been the [[center-right]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party. Since the 1990s both the Republican and Democratic parties have shifted further apart. This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom, not specifically outlined in the US Constitution. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].",

      "Political scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras.<ref>Paul Kleppner, et al. ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], which supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), which opposed the powerful central government that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 26, 2016 |title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists |url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/ |access-date=July 27, 2016 |website=Boundless Political Science |publisher=Boundless.com |archive-date=October 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013034743/https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Party realignments have recurred periodically in response to social and cultural movements and economic development.",
