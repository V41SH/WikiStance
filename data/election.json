However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Wisconsin, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Wisconsin Legislature, President Trump WON Wisconsin’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Michigan, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Michigan Legislature, President Trump WON Michigan’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

He further stated: 'The President-elect reiterated that while he ran as a Democrat, he will govern for all Americans. I offered him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and[[Barack Obama|Obama]]: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can.' While congratulating Trump 'on a hard-fought campaign' and saying he 'has the right to request recounts and pursue legal challenges', Bush stated the outcome of the election was clearly in Biden's favor.<ref name=\"Bradner\">{{Cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/08/politics/george-w-bush-congratulates-biden/index.html |title=Bush congratulates Biden, says election was 'fundamentally fair' and 'its outcome is clear' |author=Eric Bradner |work=CNN |date=November 8, 2020 |accessdate=November 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Baker\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/us/politics/george-w-bush-congratulates-biden-on-his-victory.html |title=George W.

Nevertheless, several analysts and commentators regarded this statement as a partial concession or the start of a concession on the part of the incumbent President. While asserting Trump would remain influential within the Republican Party for some time, Republican Arkansas Governor [[Asa Hutchinson]] told NBC: 'It was good actually to see President Trump tweet out that 'he won'. I think that's a start of an acknowledgment'. Trump responded: 'He only won in the eyes of the fake news media.

      "The '''1876 United States presidential election''' was the 23rd quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 7, 1876, in which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]].  It was one of the most contentious and controversial [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] in American history, and gave rise to the [[Compromise of 1877]] by which the Democrats conceded the election to Hayes in return for an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. After a controversial post-election process, Hayes was declared the winner.<ref>Keith Ian Polakoff, ''The Politics of Inertia: The Election of 1876 and the End of Reconstruction'' (1973). </ref>",
      "",
      "After President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] declined to seek a third term despite previously being expected to do so, Congressman [[James G. Blaine]] emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. However, Blaine was unable to win a majority at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]], which settled on Governor Hayes of Ohio as a compromise candidate. The [[1876 Democratic National Convention]] nominated Governor Tilden of New York on the second ballot.",
      "",
      "The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, after a first count of votes, Tilden had won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes's 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved: in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon, one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for being an \"elected or appointed official\". The question of who should have been awarded these electoral votes is the source of the continued controversy.",
      "",
      "An informal deal was struck to resolve the dispute: the [[Compromise of 1877]], which awarded all 20 electoral votes to Hayes; in return for the Democrats' acquiescence to Hayes' election, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction. The Compromise in effect ceded power in the Southern states to the Democratic [[Redeemers]], who proceeded to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise black voters]] thereafter.",
      "",

      "The '''1876 United States presidential election''' was the 23rd quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 7, 1876, in which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]].  It was one of the most contentious and controversial [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] in American history, and gave rise to the [[Compromise of 1877]] by which the Democrats conceded the election to Hayes in return for an end to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. After a controversial post-election process, Hayes was declared the winner.<ref>Keith Ian Polakoff, ''The Politics of Inertia: The Election of 1876 and the End of Reconstruction'' (1973). </ref>",
      "",
      "After President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] declined to seek a third term despite previously being expected to do so, Congressman [[James G. Blaine]] emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. However, Blaine was unable to win a majority at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]], which settled on Governor Hayes of Ohio as a compromise candidate. The [[1876 Democratic National Convention]] nominated Governor Tilden of New York on the second ballot.",
      "",
      "The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, after a first count of votes, Tilden had won 184 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to Hayes's 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved: in Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon, one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for being an \"elected or appointed official\". The question of who should have been awarded these electoral votes is the source of the continued controversy.",
      "",
      "An informal deal was struck to resolve the dispute: the [[Compromise of 1877]], which awarded all 20 electoral votes to Hayes; in return for the Democrats' acquiescence to Hayes' election, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction. The Compromise in effect ceded power in the Southern states to the Democratic [[Redeemers]], who proceeded to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise black voters]] thereafter.",

      "As soon as Andrew Jackson was put in office he expressed his belief in Manifest Destiny. This meant that America had the right to expand westward to obtain more land. By obtaining more land, America would become more powerful than England and Spain. Americans very quickly became unhappy with the amount of power Jackson held. By signing the treaty 100,000 Native Americans were forced out of their homeland. As soon as Natives resisted, the American military used violence to force them to leave everything behind and move west. The trail lasted about 800 miles, everyday they walked many miles with hardly any food and freezing cold temperatures. These harsh conditions led to the death of over four thousand Native Americans. An American soldier that escorted the Native Americans explained that the estimated four thousand that died didnt even get a proper burial. They had to restart their lives after watching their family members die. After the Natives were removed from their villages, Americans ransacked their homes and took any valuables they could find.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Solider Recalls The Trail of Tears |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/soldier-recalls-trail-tears |website=NCpedia |accessdate=November 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Trail of Tears - The Indian Removals |url=https://www.ushistory.org/us/24F.ASP |website=U.S. History Online |accessdate=November 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Union to Disunion: Andrew Jackson's Role |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/uniontodisunion/exhibits/show/manifest-destiny-and-native-am/andrew-jackson-s-role |website=MSU |accessdate=October 26 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What Happened on the Trail of Tears? |url=https://www.nps.gov/trte/learn/historyculture/what-happened-on-the-trail-of-tears.htm |website=National Parks Service |accessdate=October 27 2020}}</ref>",

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

      "",
      "The weekend after the election, Infowars host Alex Jones, along with crew members Owen Shroyer and Ali Alexander, announced they would send a caravan of vehicles from Austin, TX to Washington D.C. starting the next day to rally support for Donald Trump (https://parler.com/post/4e08833557c6497c839511f82f4dfeb9). Infowars contributor Ali Alexander suggested / started the hashtag #marchfortrump, and announced a march for Trump in Washington D.C., scheduled for Saturday, November 14.  The march was not anticipated to be massive at that time.  Infowars publicized the event for the first time on Sunday, 11/8/2020.  The next day, upon hearing about the ‘Stop the Steal Caravan’ and the ‘March For Trump,’ alt-pop musician Adam Metropolis started the hashtag #millionMAGAmarch on Parler, and began making promo images & videos for that concept.  Metropolis did this completely independently, having no relationship with Infowars.  The origin of the name ‘Million MAGA March’ was on Monday, 11/9 (https://parler.com/post/07bc7707d42a4f5397dc4ae1d2afecaf).",
      "The concept was, according to Adam, to create a manipulative title that would encourage Trump-supporters to think the turn-out was going to be good, so they would be more likely to go.  It was also to anger media outlets to increase coverage.",
      "Adam pushed promos on the social media platforms Parler, Minds, MeWe, and Gab. Harrison Smith, an Infowars anchor, saw the hashtag and began using the term “Million MAGA March” live on air during Infowars’ “The War Room” on Monday, 11/9. At this time there was still no time or location set for the so-called ‘Million MAGA March.’   The next day, the Proud Boys had announced “The Million MAGA March” publicly, and the event spread virally on Parler & Minds.",
      "Adam Metropolis contacted news sources in the US and internationally, giving a news tip about a horrible Trump rally where there would be no masks or social distancing.  He did this under ghe pseudonym ‘Calvin Ennis.’  (All outgoing emails can be forwarded for historical record.)",

This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Pennsylvania, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Pennsylvania General Assembly, President Trump WON Pennsylvania’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Murphy had ordered that mail-in ballots should be sent to all active voters in the state. The Trump campaign argued that the order violates the U.S. Constitution, which gives power to state legislatures to conduct congressional elections and select electors for the U.S. Presidency. Thereafter, the New Jersey state legislature enacted legislation to the same effect as the governor's order. In September, the Trump campaign asked U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp to prohibit vote counting before election day, and the counting of mail-in ballots that are not postmarked and received after election day. On October 6, Judge Shipp denied the request.<ref name=\":21\" />"

      "As a Democratic Congressman and due to his roots as the son of an Irish immigrant, Brendan Boyle is a keen supporter of the Good Friday Peace Agreement and in November 2020 declared his support for the continuity of the agreement above all else. Whilst his principles were judged to be highly sound, the methods he used to achieve this were deemed somewhat questionable since Boyle used the leverage of a potential free trade agreement with the United States to encourage Great Britain to water down 'Brexit' (Britain's exit from the EU) in effect reinstating all clauses of the withdrawal agreement which rendered Britain under European control to a large extent. When this information came to public knowledge this unfortunately caused a degree of outrage amongst the people in Great Britain, who judged that this stance did not allow them to become a sovereign nation once again. More significantly this stance caused some damage to the decades old 'special relationship' between the US and Great Britain in the process. Despite his threat, there remained major support for the (* yet to be declared) Democratic 'President Elect' Joe Biden in Great Britain at the time, due to widespread knowledge of his assistance during the Falklands war almost 40 years earlier.",

The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).",
