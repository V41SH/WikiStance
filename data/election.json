This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Wisconsin, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Wisconsin Legislature, President Trump WON Wisconsin’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

      "This was one of many states where a RIGGED ELECTION took place. The crooked Democrat party machine in Detroit manufactured illegal Democrat votes, threw out legal poll watchers, and were mired in many more irregularities than usual. This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Michigan, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Michigan Legislature, President Trump WON Michigan’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

Instead, I strongly believe that the statute requires that the GSA Administrator ascertain, not impose, the apparent president-elect.'<ref name=\"Kirby\"/> Due to the ascertainment, the Biden/Harris transition team has obtained funding and permission to start working with Trump administration officials across federal agencies to prepare for the Biden administration's succession in January 2021.<ref name=\"Kirby\"/> President Trump endorsed the GSA ascertainment 'in the best interest of the Country', while vowing to continue his legal struggles, which several people close to Trump as well as external commentators interpreted as an indirect concession.<ref name=\"Kirby\"/><ref name=\"HolmesHerb\">{{Cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/23/politics/transition-biden-gsa-begin/index.html |title=First on CNN: Key government agency acknowledges Biden's win and begins formal transition |author=Kristen Holmes & Jeremy Herb |work=CNN |date=November 24, 2020 |accessdate=November 24, 2020}}</ref>"

      "As soon as Andrew Jackson was put in office he expressed his belief in Manifest Destiny. This meant that America had the right to expand westward to obtain more land. By obtaining more land, America would become more powerful than England and Spain. Americans very quickly became unhappy with the amount of power Jackson held. By signing the treaty 100,000 Native Americans were forced out of their homeland. As soon as Natives resisted, the American military used violence to force them to leave everything behind and move west. The trail lasted about 800 miles, everyday they walked many miles with hardly any food and freezing cold temperatures. These harsh conditions led to the death of over four thousand Native Americans. An American soldier that escorted the Native Americans explained that the estimated four thousand that died didnt even get a proper burial. They had to restart their lives after watching their family members die. After the Natives were removed from their villages, Americans ransacked their homes and took any valuables they could find.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Solider Recalls The Trail of Tears |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/soldier-recalls-trail-tears |website=NCpedia |accessdate=November 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Trail of Tears - The Indian Removals |url=https://www.ushistory.org/us/24F.ASP |website=U.S. History Online |accessdate=November 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Union to Disunion: Andrew Jackson's Role |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/uniontodisunion/exhibits/show/manifest-destiny-and-native-am/andrew-jackson-s-role |website=MSU |accessdate=October 26 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What Happened on the Trail of Tears? |url=https://www.nps.gov/trte/learn/historyculture/what-happened-on-the-trail-of-tears.htm |website=National Parks Service |accessdate=October 27 2020}}</ref>",

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

The crooked Democrat party machines in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia manufactured illegal Democrat votes, threw out legal poll watchers, and were mired in many more irregularities than usual. This was part of a coordinated effort to STEAL the election from President Donald Trump and install Weak Joe Biden as Puppet-President of the United States. However, to the shock of the mainstream media, President Trump courageously fought back against the massive FRAUD in Pennsylvania, refusing to be cheated out of office by crooked Democrat cities and Radical Left Dominion voting machines. Thanks to the hard work of his incredible legal team, and the brave efforts of the great Court System and the Pennsylvania General Assembly, President Trump WON Pennsylvania’s Electoral College votes and a second term."

      "In 2020, a massive attempt was put into motion to steal the presidential election from President Donald J. Trump. Crooked Democrat machines in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada committed the greatest FRAUD in political history. They manufactured votes in the middle of the night, all of which went to Joe Biden. Dead people “voted” in huge numbers, all for Joe Biden. Ballot signatures were forged and duplicated, all for Joe Biden. Democrat counties unlawfully counted ballots that had not followed proper procedure. Radical Left voting machine companies like Dominion, Smartmatic, and Scytl used their Venezuelan election-rigging software to delete President Trump’s votes and add Biden votes to the fraudulent tally. And worst of all, poll observers were illegally ejected and blocked from having any view of these criminal proceedings. Throughout this, the mainstream corporate media went all out to help steal the election, falsely calling the election for Biden and then relentlessly lying to cover up the massive amount of fraud that had been exposed. Partisan Democrat election officials then rushed to certify the false and fraudulent results of the election for Biden before they could be scrutinized. Just when they thought the election had been successfully stolen, Americans rose up to STOP THE STEAL! The best lawyers in the country, such as American hero Sidney Powell, fought their case in court, revealing overwhelming evidence of massive fraud in corrupt cites on a scale never before seen in American history. They successfully proved that millions of completely illegal votes had been cast for Biden, and millions of Trump votes had been changed or deleted by Dominion and Smartmatic’s election theft software. They also proved that the election was conducted in blatant violation of the United States Constitution, though the illegal blocking of approved poll observers and discrimination against Republican voters. Through this great effort, they were able to successfully block Democrats from abusing power and prematurely certifying fraudulent and falsified results. Great judges then appropriately threw out the millions of illegal and unconstitutional votes that had been cast for Biden. With the help of courageous Republican legislatures in the rigged states, election integrity was restored, and President Trump was awarded the electoral votes he needed for re-election. In the end, this heroic effort by brave lawyers, election officials, judges, and state legislators saved America from the Democrat attempt to rig and steal the election for Joe Biden."

The Trump campaign argued that the order violates the U.S. Constitution, which gives power to state legislatures to conduct congressional elections and select electors for the U.S. Presidency. Thereafter, the New Jersey state legislature enacted legislation to the same effect as the governor's order. In September, the Trump campaign asked U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp to prohibit vote counting before election day, and the counting of mail-in ballots that are not postmarked and received after election day.

      "As a Democratic Congressman and due to his roots as the son of an Irish immigrant, Brendan Boyle is a keen supporter of the Good Friday Peace Agreement and in November 2020 declared his support for the continuity of the agreement above all else. Whilst his principles were judged to be highly sound, the methods he used to achieve this were deemed somewhat questionable since Boyle used the leverage of a potential free trade agreement with the United States to encourage Great Britain to water down 'Brexit' (Britain's exit from the EU) in effect reinstating all clauses of the withdrawal agreement which rendered Britain under European control to a large extent. When this information came to public knowledge this unfortunately caused a degree of outrage amongst the people in Great Britain, who judged that this stance did not allow them to become a sovereign nation once again. More significantly this stance caused some damage to the decades old 'special relationship' between the US and Great Britain in the process. Despite his threat, there remained major support for the (* yet to be declared) Democratic 'President Elect' Joe Biden in Great Britain at the time, due to widespread knowledge of his assistance during the Falklands war almost 40 years earlier.",

The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).",

      "The election was not close with Hickenlooper winning by 9.3%, with still 3% left to be counted. Hickenlooper's win was expected, as [[Colorado]] has moved more toward being a blue state. Key to Hickenlooper's victory was [[Denver County]] home of [[Denver]], and [[Denver]]'s suburban counties, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, and Jefferson. Gardner did do well in the typically red [[El Paso County]] home of [[Colorado Springs]]. Gardner also did well in many rural areas of the state. However, Hickenlooper's strong performance in heavily populated counties proved too much for Gardner to overcome. Hickenlooper was also likely helped by now President-Elect [[Joseph R. Biden]] who won the Centennial State by 13.5%. Hickenlooper will be the first senator from [[Colorado]] who was also the [[Governor of Colorado]] since Senator [[Edwin Johnson]] was elected in 1936. Senator-Elect Hickenlooper will be sworn in on January 3, 2021 for a six year term that expires on January 3, 2027."
