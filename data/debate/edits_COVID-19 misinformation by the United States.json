      "<<This article is out of date, and is inaccurate relative to the title.  The current version heavily focuses on the Federal Government and Donald Trump, creating the image that US Government disinformation occurred at the Federal level, and ended with the Trump Administration.  Actually, disinformation has also been promoted by some local governments, including well into the Biden Administration, which have resulted in large scale flare ups and hospital congestion.  For example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have repeatedly lied about the risk of the disease, the effectiveness of vaccines, masking, and social distancing; they have instead implemented policies that have led to much higher number of cases and deaths, in contrast with other states.  While the Biden Administration is not responsible for the state level actions, time-wise, disinformation has continued after Trump left office.>>{{short description|Disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic propagated by officials of the U.S. government}}"
