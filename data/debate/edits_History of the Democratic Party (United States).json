      "The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is the oldest voter-based [[political party]] in the world and the oldest existing [[Political parties of the United States|political party in the United States]]. The party's modern institutions were formed in the 1830s and 1840s.<ref>{{citation|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|last=Witcover|first=Jules|year=2003|chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Micklethwait|author-link=John Micklethwait|author2=Wooldridge, Adrian|title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America|url=https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick|url-access=registration|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick/page/15 15]}} \"The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party.”</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Kenneth|last1=Janda|first2=Jeffrey M.|last2=Berry|first3=Jerry|last3=Goldman|title=The Challenge of Democracy: American Government in Global Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_lC8k3SELMC&pg=PA276|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=276|isbn=9780495906186}}</ref> Known as the party of the \"common man,\" the early Democratic Party stood for individual rights and state sovereignty, but opposed banks and high tariffs. During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under Presidents [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.",

      "The Democratic Party has changed significantly during its more than two centuries of existence. During the 19th century the party supported or tolerated slavery, and it opposed civil rights reforms after the American Civil War in order to retain the support of Southern voters. From 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s–1920s) and opposed imperialistic expansion abroad while sponsoring liberal reforms at home.",
      "Starting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the party dominated during the [[Fifth Party System]], which lasted from 1932 until about 1970s. In response to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]], the party employed [[Social liberalism|liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat financial crises and emergency bank closings, with policies continuing into [[World War II]]. The Party kept the [[White House]] after Roosevelt's death in April 1945, reelecting former Vice President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1948. During this period, the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] only successfully elected one president (Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956) and was the minority in Congress all but twice (the exceptions being 1946 and 1952). Powerful committee chairmanships were awarded automatically on the basis of seniority, which gave power especially to long-serving Southerners.  Important Democratic leaders during this time included Presidents Harry S. Truman (1945–1953), [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961–1963) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963–1969). Republican [[Richard Nixon]] won the White House in 1968 and 1972, leading to the end of the New Deal era.",

      "Democrats have won six out of the last twelve presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]], 1977–1981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]], 1993–2001), [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]], 2009–2017), and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] (with 46th President [[Joe Biden]], 2021–present). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in both elections (with candidates [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively). These were two of the four [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|presidential elections in which Democrats won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College]], the others being the presidential elections in [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]] and [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]].",
