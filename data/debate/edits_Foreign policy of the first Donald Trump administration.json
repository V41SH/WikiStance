In the book '''The Madman Theory''' by CNN anchor and best selling author [[Jim Scuitto]], the former Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East [[Mick Mulroy]] said that the decision ran contrary to one of the main tenants of the [[National Defense Strategy (United States)]] of building and maintaining partners, that the [[YPG]] elements of the SDF were only ones capable of providing the combat leadership needed to defeat ISIS and that the Commander of the SDF General [[Mazloum Abdi]] sent a letter to U.S. servicemembers essentially absolving them of the decision of President Trump, as he knew they would never have abandoned them. <ref>https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-madman-theory-jim-sciutto?variant=32117494939682</ref>"
