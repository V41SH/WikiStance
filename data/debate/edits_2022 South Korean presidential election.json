A Hankyoreh commentary said PPP candidates like Yoo Seong-min, Won Hee-ryong, and Choi Jae-hyung, and Lee Nak-yeon and Chung Sye-kyun on the Democratic side struggled in their respective party primaries as they were too \"elite\" and too \"respectable\". The commentary also attributed to the success of Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic candidate, and Hong Jun-pyo and Yoon Seok-youl on the PPP side due to the increasing tendency to vote with the heart instead of the brain and to prioritize candidate attributes and authentic over competence.<ref>{{cite news |date= 26 September 2021|title= The golden era of bad guys running for president in S.
