      "Also on October 28, 2021, [[Kathleen Kingsbury]], opinion editor of [[The New York Times]], published an essay titled, \"Farewell, Nick Kristof.\" She wrote, \"Nick has shown us how to pursue journalism as both a noble and a purposeful mission, to help the less fortunate and force the powerful and privileged not to look away from the pain so common in this world. He did so not in a hectoring or guilt-inducing way, but in the spirit of trying to make a difference.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kingsbury|first=Kathleen|date=2021-10-28|title=Opinion {{!}} Farewell, Nick Kristof|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/nick-kristof-leaving-new-york-times.html|access-date=2021-10-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>"
