      "A Democrat, [[Robert C. Byrd]], was a recruiter for the Klan while in his 20s, rising to the title of [[Kleagle]] and Exalted Cyclops of his local chapter.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> After leaving the group, Byrd spoke in favor of the Klan during his early political career.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> Byrd wrote a letter in 1946 to the group's [[Grand Wizard|Imperial Wizard]] stating \"The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia.\" However, when running for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1952, he announced \"After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan.\" He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was [[anti-communist]].",

      "Byrd later called joining the KKK \"the greatest mistake I ever made.\" Byrd attempted to explain or defend his former membership in the Klan in his 1958 U.S. Senate campaign when he was 41 years old. Byrd, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], eventually became his party leader in the Senate. Byrd later said joining the Klan was his \"greatest mistake,\" and after his death, the [[NAACP]] released a statement praising Byrd, acknowledging his former affiliation with the Klan and saying that he \"became a champion for civil rights and liberties\" and \"came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda\". In a 2001 interview, Byrd used the term \"white niggers\" twice during a national television broadcast. The full quote ran as follows: \"My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time. I'm going to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.\" Byrd later apologized for the phrase and admitted that it \"has no place in today's society,\" and did not clarify the intended meaning of the term in his context."
