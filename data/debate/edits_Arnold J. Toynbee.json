      "In regards to [[Ukraine]], or ''[[Little Russia]]'', Toynbee rejected both [[home rule]]<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n346/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref> and a federal solution for Ukraine.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n348/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref> Toynbee's objection to the federal solution stemmed from his fear that a federated Russia would be too divided to have a unifying center of gravity and would thus be at risk of fragmentation and breaking up just like the [[United States of America]] previously did for a time during [[American Civil War|its own civil war]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n348/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref> In place of autonomy, Toynbee proposed making the [[Ukrainian language]] [[Official language|co-official]] in the [[Great Russian]] parts of the Russian Empire so that Ukrainians (or Little Russians) could become members of the Russian body politic as Great Russians' peers rather than as Great Russians' inferiors.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n350/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref> Toynbee also argued that if the Ukrainian language will not be able to become competitive with Russian even if the Ukrainian language will be given official status in Russia, then this would prove once and for all the superior vitality of the [[Russian language]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n354/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref>",
      "",
      "In regards to future Russian expansion, Toynbee endorsed the idea of Russia conquering [[Outer Mongolia]] and the [[Tarim Basin]], arguing the Russia could improve and revitalize these territories just like the US did when it conquered the [[Mexican Cession]] territories from Mexico back in 1847.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n362/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref> In his book, Toynbee also endorsed the idea of having Russia annex both [[Pontus]] and the [[Armenian Vilayets]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nationalitywar00toyngoog/page/n424/mode/2up?q=slovenia]</ref>"
