      "==Confusion with Matt Gaetz==",
      "On October 16 2020 at a Florida rally for his reelection then President Trump referred to Matt Gaetz, a congressman and longtime Trump supporter, who was standing next to his podium, as \"Rick Gates\" several times.  The President did this as he was looking directly at Mr Gaetz.  The incident provoked discussion online as to the then Presidents fitness for office, as it was not the first time the President had confused who he was speaking with in a public setting.  The Presidential confusion extended beyond Mr Gaetz as well, as the President called hypersonic weapons \"hydrophonic\" and confused Ferguson Missouri with \"Henderson\"."
