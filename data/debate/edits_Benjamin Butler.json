      "According to biographer Hans L. Trefousse:",
      ":Butler was one of the most controversial 19th-century American politicians. Demagogue, speculator, military bungler, and sharp legal practitioner--he was all of these; and he also was a fearless advocate of justice for the downtrodden, a resourceful military administrator, and an astonishing innovator.  He was passionately hated and equally strongly admired, and if the South called him \"Beast,\" his constituents in Massachusetts were fascinated by him....As a leading advocate of radical Reconstruction, Butler played an important role in the conflict between president and Congress. His effectiveness was marred by the frequency with which engaged in personal altercations, and his conduct as one of the principal managers of the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson was dubious. Nevertheless he deserves recognition as a persistent critic of southern terrorism and is one of the chief authors of the civil Rights act of 1875.  <ref>Hans L. Trefousse, “Butler, Benjamin Franklin” in  John A. Garraty, ed. ''Encyclopedia of American Biography'' (2nd ed. 1996) pp. 154–156.
