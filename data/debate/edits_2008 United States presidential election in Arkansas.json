      "The 2008 election reflected as, arguably, the last chance Democrats had to be influential in Arkansas. Two years later, all but one Congressional seat was lost to the Republicans in the [[2010 United States elections|midterms]], and then that one was lost in the [[2014 United States elections|2014 midterms]]. Hillary Clinton remained popular in Arkansas less than a decade after her husband was president, and only four years prior to the state being out of reach for the party; her statewide popularity cratered over the next eight years, culminating in a dismal showing in the state in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] as the Democratic nominee. (Coincidentally, Clinton won every county Obama did in 2008, except for [[Woodruff County, Arkansas|Woodruff]].)",
      "",
      "After this election, Arkansas became increasingly referred to as a \"safe\" Republican state, with the social liberalism of the Democratic Party failing to resonate in this highly conservative, [[Bible Belt]] state. One should recall that [[Mike Huckabee]], the former governor of the state who took office only three years after Bill Clinton, was a highly-favored contender in the GOP primary."
