      "In October 2020, President Trump delivered for the American people in their time of need, sending $1200 direct payments to every American. After month of bickering from the do-nothing Congress, President Trump personally made sure a stimulus deal was reached for us. He overcame the Democrat obstruction, signing a bill that got hard-working Americans the help they needed right away. For this, we the American people showed our appreciation by re-electing President Trump in a landslide on November 3! #MAGA"
