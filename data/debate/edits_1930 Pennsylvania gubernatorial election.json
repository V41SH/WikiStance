      "In 1926, Gifford Pinchot (then Governor of Pennsylvania) and [[William Scott Vare]] (U.S. Representative and boss of the powerful Philadelphia political machine) both challenged incumbent United States Senator [[George W. Pepper]] in the Republican primary. Pepper carried nearly every county in the state, but Vare the race won narrowly thanks to a 224,000 vote margin in [[Philadelphia County]].<ref>https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=817591</ref> Vare went on to win the general election by a wider margin, again relying on a large margin from Philadelphia.",

      "Pinchot, acting in his role as Governor, declined to certify the results of Vare's election.
