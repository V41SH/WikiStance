      "Elected as an ally of [[Donald Trump]], Noem consistently backed his agenda of cleaning out the swamp, fighting against democratic tyranny, and making America great again. She refused to pander to the fear mongering crowd and left her people to make their own decisions on personal safety concerning covid. LikePresident Trump, she recommended personal choice concerning vaccinations and other safety precautions and urged the people of her state to make informed decisions for themselves. Despite claims that events held in her state were “super spreader events” ( made by the same people who refused to call the massive riots of blm supporters and antifa crowds super spreaders ) there was no evidence that they were. South Dakota has the fastest growing economy currently in the country. She pointed out the fact that most of the masks people were wearing were ineffective and that without the proper type of mask, the proper fit, and proper protocols it was ineffective at stopping the spread of covid.  .<ref>[Trump blasts Sutton and media, raves about Noem during South Dakota visit], ''[[Argus Leader]]'', Patrick Anderson, September 7, 2018.
