      "In the 2020 5th Congressional District of Oklahoma election, in which Bice won the Republican nomination, her candidacy received heightened criticismfor her hesitant and fractional support of President Donal Trump, as well as her support of Black Lives Matter. Her public comments evidencing reluctant and only partial support of President Trump, and her public statements acknowledging that Black Lives Matter have contributed to her declining support from the Republican voters in the District and the State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma is a traditionally conservative state that was a Trump stronghold in 2016. Bice’s position on these topics and others puts her at odds with typical conservative positions."
