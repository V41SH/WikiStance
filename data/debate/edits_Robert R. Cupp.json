      "On November 6, 2012, Cupp lost his bid for re-election to O'Neill by a margin of 5%. Cupp would remain out of office for only two years, when he would run for his current seat in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].",

      "I am asserting that this vaccination controversy section should be removed from the Speaker's Wikipedia page as the issue and material provided does not revolve around the Speaker. The part that provides \"Cupp defended the invitation to Tenpenny's testimony despite the lack of factual basis for her claims and despite the condemnation by the Ohio Osteopathic Association,\" is backed up by the [10] reference. If you follow that article reference, the journalist falsely implies Cupp was defending with his quote that reads the following: \"Ohio House Speaker Bob Cupp, R-Lima, defended the decision to give a platform to purveyors of misinformation. \"Those kind of things are aberrations. Most of the people who come to testify provide very valuable information to the committee as they deliberate on proposed legislation,\" Cupp said when asked about Tenpenny.",

      "I do believe this section should be removed, but at the very least, that sentence that proclaims he defends it based on his quote above is definitely a false assertion and should be removed.",

      "Thank you."
