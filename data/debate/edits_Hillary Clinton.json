      "In 2018, a false rumor circling around the internet called “frazzledrip,” or frazzled.rip, claimed that a video of Hillary and [[Huma Abedin]] [[Rape|raped]], tortured, [[Skinning|ripped the face off]], killed, and drank the blood of a young girl for a satanic ritual. The false video was allegedly found on [[Anthony Weiner]]’s laptop, prior to his arrest in 2017. The video is closely connected to [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|PizzaGate]] and [[QAnon]]."
