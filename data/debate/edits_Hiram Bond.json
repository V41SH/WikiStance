      "Between 1879 and 1887 Judge Hiram Bond was also chief officer of a firm financed by investors from Boston led by [[Willard T. Sears]] and [[Moses Kimball]]. This firm had acquired rights to construct an urban transit system under the name [[Kings County Elevated Railway]]. This line was to run from the Fulton Ferry Terminal inland to the Queens border at City Line. Williard T. Sears was an architect who was able to add value designing the overpasses and bridges. Their package of rights and initial construction was eventually sold off to New York City investors led by Gen. [http://localhistory.morrisville.edu/sites/unitinfo/jourdan-158.html James Jourdan] due to the lack of support for the Bostonians by the local political leaders. Due to the persistence of Jourdan the project eventually got off the ground. The company directors besides Jourdan were [[Edward A. Abbott]], [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/02/103255739.pdf Henry J. Davison], [[Harvey Farrington]], [[Wendell Goodwin]], [[Henry J. Robinson]], [[James O. Sheldon]] and [[William A. Read]]. William A. Read was the financier whose company Read & Company later became [[Dillon, Read]]. Hiram's association with the KCER was so well known that it was commonly referred to as \"Judge Bond's Road\" according to the New York Times. During this period of time he was inducted into the [[The Players (New York City)|Players Club]] at [[Gramercy Park]] founded by actor [[Edwin Booth]] for actors and lovers of the theater. He was also a member of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and Lawyers Club of New York. During this time he maintained an office at 115 Broadway in Manhattan and a townhouse in Brooklyn."
