      "Michigan was one of the many states that the Democrats attempted to RIG with massive mail-in ballot fraud in 2020. The election was a complete disaster, as unsolicited mail-in ballots could not be counted on November 3 and the state refused to declare President Trump as its rightful winner. As a result, Michigan Republicans and the court system stepped in and put a stop to the illegal mail-in scam, ending the charade of “counting” unsolicited fraudulent Democrat ballots indefinitely. Even when Democrat lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s Great Supreme Court Justices prevented a RIGGED ELECTION and declared him the rightful winner based on legally cast votes."
