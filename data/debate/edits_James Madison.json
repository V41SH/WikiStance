      "Retrospectively, in 1974, historian James Banner criticized Madison for his protection of a corrupt General [[James Wilkinson]] in the Army. Wilkinson had been involved in the [[Burr Conspiracy|Aaron Burr conspiracy]] during the Jefferson Administration, was on retainer of Spain, and had a high mortality rate among soldiers. Wilkinson had also botched a campaign during the [[War of 1812]]. Madison finally mustered Wilkinson out of the Army in 1815.{{sfn|Banner Jr.|1974|pp=35â€“37, 45}}"

      "Madison was small in stature, had bright blue eyes, a strong demeanor, and was known to be humorous at small gatherings. Madison suffered from serious illnesses, nervousness, and was often exhausted after periods of stress. Madison often feared for the worst and was a [[hypochondriac]]. However, Madison was in good health, while he lived a long life, without the common maladies of his times.{{sfn|Ketcham|2002|p=58}}"
