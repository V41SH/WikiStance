      "In July 2020, conservative commentator [[Ann Coulter]] sent a pair of [[Twitter|tweets]] which appeared to endorse McGrath over McConnell.<ref>The first tweet called McGrath \"lovely\" and highlighted her service in the Marine Corps. Coulter's second Tweet didn't explicitly endorse McGrath, but made it clear she believes McConnell should be defeated. Referring to McConnell as a \"Republican in name only\" (RINO) she encouraged voters to stay home on election day, to seemingly help McGrath win. {{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethcohen/2020/07/10/ann-coulter-endorsed-a-democrat/|work=Forbes|title= Ann Coulter Endorsed A Democrat Over Mitch McConnell â€” Has The GOP Meltdown Begun?|author=Cohen, Seth|date=July 10, 2020|access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref>"
