      "The February 1804 Democratic-Republican [[congressional nominating caucus]] selected the ticket. Unlike the previous election, the nominating caucus did not meet in secret. Jefferson's re-nomination was never in any real doubt, with the real issue being seen as who the party would nominate to replace Vice President [[Aaron Burr]], whose relationship with Jefferson had soured. Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] of New York was chosen as Jefferson's running mate, continuing the party's tradition of nominating a ticket consisting of a Virginian and a New Yorker.<ref name=\"deskins1\">{{cite book|last1=Deskins|first1=Donald Richard|last2=Walton|first2=Hanes|last3=Puckett|first3=Sherman|title=Presidential Elections, 1789-2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data|date=2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=41–42}}</ref>",
