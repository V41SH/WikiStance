White, no fan of homosexuality, but unwilling to take a public position on the issue as a judge, declined. Burger wrote his own concurring opinion denouncing homosexuality.<ref>{{cite web |url=upreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/478/186/#tab-opinion-1956747 |publisher=Justia}}</ref> Burger quoted approvingly a description of homosexuality as \"worse than [[rape]]\". He even implied that homosexuals should be executed, as he cited an [[ancient Roman]] law making homosexual acts a capital crime. Burger's extreme  views were virtually unheard of among mainstream conservatives such as the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell Sr.]], and aligned him with fringe figures such as [[R.J. Rushdoony]]."
