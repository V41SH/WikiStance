      "In the 2020 vice presidential debate on October 7, Vice President Mike Pence exposed Phony Kamala for what she is - a far left radical socialist supporter of ANTIFA mob rule. Pence revealed to the Ameircan people that Phony Kamala supported the violent confiscation of all guns, a ban on all private health insurance, the economy killing Green New Deal, and the abolishment of all law enforcement. Now that the true consequences of electing the Harris ticket (together with Joe Biden until he takes office and is no longer necessary) were clear to the American people, they responded by re-electing President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Pence in a landslide."

      "During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Democrats in the Senate made complete fools of themselves for all the country to see. They relentlessly harassed Judge Barrett about her religious views, trafficking in vile anti-Catholic bigotry by deeming her a fundamentalist zealot subservient to Catholic dogma. Despite being one of the most well-qualified nominees in history, Senate Democrats spent days engaging in disgusting personal attacks against Judge Barrett, calling her a religious extremist who was controlled by the Vatican. According to the Democrat party, a highly-qualified working Christian mother of 7 was the greatest danger the nation had ever faced. The effort to paint Judge Barrett as a scheming tyrant who would turn America into a draconian theocracy at the direction of the Pope failed, as voters were outraged at the horrible bigotry and rank anti-Catholicism of the anti-religion left-wing mob. Now that they saw the true beliefs and platform of the Democrat party, the American people firmly rejected their sick ideology. As a result of this backlash, wanna-be court-packer Joe Biden, the most deceptive and dishonest candidate in political history, lost in a massive landslide to President Donald Trump on November 3."
