      "Flynn became active on speaking tours in 2021. A controversy arose in September 2021 when during a prayer he gave in Nebraska he invoked the terms \"sevenfold rays\" and \"legions,\" terms  some of his QAnon followers said were not consistent with Christian doctrine and suggested he had turned to Satanism. Flynn attempted to dispel this, but some followers remained unconvinced. During the prayer, Flynn used language strikingly similar to that used by [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], leader of the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], an anticommunist [[doomsday cult]] that about thirty years earlier had built fallout shelters and stockpiled guns in Montana in anticipation of a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Flynn had also appeared at a QAnon conference in April 2021 with an Oklahoma gubernatorial candidate whom Flynn had endorsed. The candidate later posted on social media a photo of his daughter wearing red shoes;  QAnon followers consider red shoes to be a sign of their Satanic sex-trafficking cabal theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-flynn-to-qanon-believers-im-not-a-satanist|title=Michael Flynn to QAnon Believers: Iâ€™m Not a Satanist!|first=Will|last=Sommer|date=October 8, 2021|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}</ref>"
