      "*[[Jeremy B. Rosen]]: On October 10, 2018,  President Trump announced his intent to nominate Rosen to serve as a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On November 13, 2018, his nomination was sent to the Senate.  Democrats claimed that Rosen was a conservative ideologue.  [[U.S. Senator]] [[Kamala Harris]] refused to turn in her [[blue slip]] consenting to the nomination.  Rosen's supporters pointed out that he is a well-regarded appellate lawyer and that many Democrats in the California legal community support him, but his nomination has not been acted upon.<ref>{{https://dailyjournal.com/articles/355234-us-judge-nominee-appears-stalled-over-his-affiliation-with-federalist-society}}</ref>"
