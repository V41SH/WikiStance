      "Bevin carried 97 of Kentucky's 120 counties. However, Beshear swamped Bevin in urban areas. Beshear carried the state's two largest counties, [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson]] and [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette]]–home to Louisville and Lexington, respectively–with over 60 percent of the vote. He also narrowly carried the state's third-largest county, [[Kenton County, Kentucky|Kenton County]], which is normally very Republican.",
