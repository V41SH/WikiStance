      "===Emergency Coronavirus Spending Plan===",
      "In March 2020, The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed an $8.3 billion emergency new coronavirus spending plan on Wednesday that earned only two \"no\" votes, with one of them coming from Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona.  The bill, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., passed 415-2. The measure would later go to the Senate, where it passed.  Biggs voted against the bill, accusing Democrats of politicizing the deadly virus by seeking to outdo President Donald Trump's request for $2.5 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/03/04/rep-andy-biggs-votes-against-coronavirus-funding-bill/4956972002/|title=The U.S. House votes overwhelmingly to pass $8.3B coronavirus bill. 1 Arizonan votes no|date=March 4, 2020|website=Source Politics}}</ref>",
