      "Louisiana was long known for its toleration of corruption in government. [[Bill Dodd]], former lieutenant governor and education superintendent, in his book ''Peapatch Politics: The [[Earl Long]] Era in Louisiana Politics'' describes corruption as \"a way of life, inherited, and made quasi-respectable and legal by the French freebooters who founded, operated, and left us as the governmental blueprint that is still Louisiana's constitutional and civil law.\" Dodd notes furthermore that some attribute the corruption to \"outlaws, gamblers, and fortune hunters who came off the [[Appalachian Mountains|mountains]] and down the [[Mississippi River]] to add their flavor to the Louisiana pot."
