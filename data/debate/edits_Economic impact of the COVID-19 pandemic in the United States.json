      "On October 29, 2020, the United States Department of Commerce released the third quarter GDP report, showing remarkable and record-breaking economic growth that surpassed even the highest expectations. Thanks to the bold action and strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump, America’s economy had been saved and was now fully recovered. This report showed the amazing success of the Great American Comeback and reminded voters of the incredible job President Trump had done building the greatest economy of all time. This presented the American people with a stark contrast between more staggering economic prosperity under President Trump or high taxes and permanent lockdowns under Weak Joe Biden. Thanks to his record of incredible economic achievement, President Trump surged to a re-election victory in November’s election."
