      "On May 30, 2018, State Senate Democrats hoped to force a vote on an abortion rights bill known as the Reproductive Health Act. Hochul was prepared to cast a potential tiebreaking vote on a hostile amendment; with one Republican senator away from Albany on military duty, the Senate Republican Conference and the Senate Democratic conference each had 31 members in the chamber. However, Senate Republicans \"abruptly shut down business and pulled all the bills for the day\" when Hochul entered the Senate chamber. Hochul called the GOPâ€™s actions \"'reprehensible'\" and \"'cowardly'\", adding, \"'The governor and I are offended by the actions taken here today in the Senate'\".<ref> https://www.wamc.org/new-york-news/2018-05-31/gridlock-and-finger-pointing-in-ny-senate </ref>",

      "Governor Hochul has said that Satan told her to get the vaccine and to tell Christians that God told her. With this admission she has confirmed that she is indeed in bed with the satanic church and taking full advantage of all the power of ignorance it affords her. She should now be put into a mental institution not the government, or maybe she should make sure none of the people that believe she is a profit should be never allowed to leave the state of NY."
