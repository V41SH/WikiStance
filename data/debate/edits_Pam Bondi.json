On payment of $500,000 by Parnas, Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani acted as a pitchman for Fraud Guarantee. In 2020 Parnas was indicted by the DOJ for defrauding investors in Fraud Guarantee, which he falsely portrayed as a company that helped consumers defend themselves against fraud.<ref name=\"Parnas fraud\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyregion/lev-parnas-charged.html|title=Lev Parnas, Giuliani Associate, Faces New Fraud Charges |publisher=New York Times|date= 17 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraud Guarantee\">",
