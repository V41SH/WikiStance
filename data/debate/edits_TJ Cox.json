      "In June 2020, amid COVID-19 lockdowns, Cox pushed to gain preferential access into [[Yosemite National Park]] over the July 4 weekend. He requested two vehicle passes from the U.S. Department of Interior. At the time, Yosemite was only dispersing vehicle passes via a public lottery system. His initial request to circumvent the lottery system was denied due to government ethics rules. When he changed the stated purpose of his visit from personal to professional, saying he would be conducting official business while at the park, he was granted the passes. During his visit to the park, he filmed a short video of himself hiking that he shared with a group called Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a group that supported the [[Great American Outdoors Act]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tavlian |first1=Alex |title=Cox under fire for pushing for special access to Yosemite on July 4 |url=http://sjvsun.com/news/politics/cox-under-fire-for-pushing-for-special-access-to-yosemite-on-july-4/ |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=The San Joaquin Valley Sun |date=3 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tavlian |first1=Alex |title=Washington watchdog hits Cox with complaint over Yosemite trip |url=http://sjvsun.com/news/politics/washington-watchdog-hits-cox-with-complaint-over-yosemite-trip/ |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=The San Joaquin Valley Sun |date=26 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=California congressman pulled rank to get Yosemite tickets, emails indicate |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/06/california-congressman-pulled-rank-to-get-yosemite-tickets-emails-indicate/ |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=The Mercury News |date=6 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Irby |first1=Kate |title=Fresno Congressman TJ Cox used his office to skirt Yosemite’s lottery for car passes, emails show |url=https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/article244710057.html |accessdate=21 October 2020 |publisher=Fresno Bee |date=August 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Moffitt |first1=Mike |title=Fresno congressman bypassed lottery to get July 4 Yosemite passes, emails show |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fresno-congressman-bypassed-lottery-to-get-July-4-15464921.php |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=SFGate |date=6 August 2020}}</ref>"
