      "The 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was won by Glenn Youngkin in an enormous upset. For months, the liberal mainstream media had said the Virginia would never vote for a Republican and that Creepy Clintonite Terry McAuliffe would win in a rout, but they had no idea how much BACKLASH and OUTRAGE the Democrat party had stirred. All over the great Commonwealth, people were fed up with the far-left agenda of Joe Biden, the most unpopular and hated president in American history. While Joe and Terry were pushing Critical Race Theory, Virginians realized that Democrat socialist policies had wrecked the economy, skyrocketed inflation, and created shortages of anything and everything. Then, in an act of total desperation, Terry and his campaign disgracefully tried to slander Glenn Youngkin as a Neo-Nazi. The people of Virginia were not fooled by these lies, however, and Glenn won BIG, proving that a massive RED WAVE had begun for Republicans across the country!"
