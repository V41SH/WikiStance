      "One notable critic of Butler was [[Beat poet]] [[Allen Ginsberg]].  While attending Columbia, Ginsberg scrawled the phrases \"Butler Has No Balls\" and \"Fuck The Jews\" in the grime on his dirty dorm window in Hartley Hall. (The dorm maid reported the graffiti to College dean [[Herbert Hawkes]], who summoned Ginsberg and told him, \"I hope you realize the enormity of what you've done\". This incident was among the reasons that Ginsberg was suspended from Columbia.){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}"
