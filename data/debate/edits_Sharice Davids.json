      "Kansas City [[NPR]] member station [[KCUR]] fact-checked the claims that Yoder and Davids made in separate interviews on their station, and gave Yoder an \"F\". Yoder said that immigrants were making false asylum claims, and would increase crime. Davids said that she supported single payer health care, but it could not be enacted with Republicans in the White House. Meanwhile she supports short-term goals like allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and getting generics to market faster. KCUR said that Davids' claim that teachers aren't paid enough, and can no longer take tax deductions for buying their own school supplies, was \"partly true and partly false,\" since the tax deduction was reinstated.<ref>[https://www.kcur.org/post/we-fact-checked-two-candidates-kansas-3rd-district-and-one-got-f We Fact-Checked The Two Candidates In Kansas' 3rd District, And One Got An 'F'], By Celisa Calacal, KCUR, October 29, 2018</ref>"
