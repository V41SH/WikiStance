      "Senator Matsunaga's greatest legacy is The United States Institute of Peace, an American non-partisan, independent, federal institution that provides analysis of and is involved in conflicts around the world. The United States Institute of Peace Act, passed in 1984, calls for the Institute to \"serve the people and the Government through the widest possible range of education and training, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence\".",
      "",
      "The Institute carries out this mission by operating programs in conflict zones, conducting research and analysis, operating a training academy and public education center, providing grants for research and fieldwork, convening conferences and workshops, and building the academic and policy fields of international conflict management and peacebuilding. On many of its projects, the Institute works in partnership with nongovernmental organizations, higher and secondary educational institutions, international organizations, local organizations, and U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Defense.",
