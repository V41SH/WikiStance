      "Many celebrities have actively promoted getting vaccinated for COVID-19.<ref name=Glamour/> In previous pandemics, such as polio in the 1950s, famous people were setting an example. For example, in 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] were photographed being vaccinated with a news story in the \"New York Times\" when less than 1% of teenagers had yet received their polio vaccination.<ref name=Glamour/> Such celebrity endorsements were considered essential to help raise vaccine rates.",
      "",
      "Similarly, the COVID-19 vaccines are also endorsed for the same reasons. Media celebrities have publicized themselves getting vaccinated, giving their firsthand accounts. They did so to help quell skepticism at a time vaccinations were being given across the world. Among them were [[Anthony Anderson]], who was initially \"on the fence\" about it but then changed his mind. He wanted to encourage others to do the same. [[Britney Spears]] received her vaccine dose, which she posted with a video on social media, stating how she \"felt nothing\" and was \"fine\" after her shot.<ref name=USAToday>[https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/celebrities/2021/01/11/queen-elizabeth-joan-collins-more-celebs-getting-covid-19-vaccine/6630401002/ \"Duchess Kate, Ellen DeGeneres and more celebs who got the COVID-19 vaccine\"], ''USA Today'', June 4, 2021</ref>",

      "To further those efforts, in April 2021, President [[Joe Biden]], former President [[Barack Obama]] and a slew of celebrities appeared on an NBC Prime Time Special, \"Roll Up Your Sleeves,\" which they hoped would boost vaccination rates.
