      "In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to [[Northern Ireland]], but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the British government. In November 1995, in a ceasefire during [[the Troubles]], Clinton became the first president to visit Northern Ireland, examining both of the two divided communities of [[Belfast]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/30/newsid_4459000/4459860.stm|title=1995: Clinton kindles hope in Northern Ireland|date=November 30, 1995 |language=en-GB |access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref> Despite [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups.
