In the campaign appearance, Perdue described Harris as \"Kah-mah-la or Kah-ma-la or Kamamboamamla\", a remark which drew laughter from the crowd. A spokesman for Perdue responded to the criticism with the statement \"Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris' name, and he didn't mean anything by it. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing.\"<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/16/georgia-sen-perdue-faces-criticism-after-mocking-kamala-harris-name/3686517001/</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-perdue-republican-senator-criticized-for-repeatedly-mispronouncing-kamala-harris-name-at-rally/</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/politics/david-perdue-kamala-harris/index.html</ref><ref>https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/16/david-perdue-mocks-kamala-harris-name-429996</ref>"
