      "**Cult expert [[Steven Hassan]] argues Trumpism resembles a cult since Trump “employs many of the same techniques as prominent cult leaders and displays many of the same personality traits”; namely a belief that he is \"the only one with the answers, the only one who can fix things\", a \"deep need ... to be the center of attention ... to control others\", a lack of empathy for them, and propensity to \"lie without hesitation\". Trump is supported in the conservative and religious media by a cult-like \"black-and-white, all-or-nothing, good-versus-evil, authoritarian view of reality that is mostly fear-based\", and by denial of facts that do not \"protect the image of the leader.\"  Growing up Trump was influenced by the beliefs of his father and [[Norman Vincent Peale]]’s church \"that the only sin is doubting yourself\", but if you avoid that sin \"magical things are going to happen\".<ref name=vox-hassan>{{cite news|first1=Steve |last1=Hasan |date=26 January 2020 |title=The four characteristics of Trumpism |agency=Vox |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/13/20992370/trump-republican-party-cult-steven-hassan |accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref>",
