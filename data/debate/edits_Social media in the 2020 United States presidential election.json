      "In the section, \"Donald Trump Campaign\" and \"Joe Biden Campaign\" there is no clear information and data based on how these candidates are expressing their platform especially under the circumstances we are in. I think each candidate should have its personal report on their affect on social media and how each candidates campaign is growing based on social media. The article barely spends any time going over Joe Biden's campaign which can give a bias outlook. I think more information needs to be represented on social media apps that are not as popular but still being used for the campaign as well as data comparing social media usage 2016 and 2020.

      "As the Election Day for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election gets closer, users on social media as well as candidates' campaigns are creating informational content to share to promote voting, regardless of in-person or mail-in voting. As previously mentioned, due to COVID-19, the increase of social media usage goes beyond the human craving to stay connected. In recent months, social media influencers have expressed political views and opinions on the upcoming election to encourage followers to vote. Additionally, due to the significant presence of Black Lives Matter movement and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Trump administration<ref>{{Cite web|title=How Black Lives Matter Could Reshape the 2020 Elections|url=https://time.com/5852534/black-lives-matter-2020-elections-voting/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Time}}</ref> on social media, there is an urgency among eligible voters of all ages to cast a vote. Normally, voting in-person has been the traditional way for the U.S. to account for votes and conduct elections from primary to presidential elections for decades. However, recently, the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election will be mainly mail-in voting due to the new social distancing regulations for safety reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be some areas across the U.S. that will be hosting in-person voting that accommodate with COVID-19 safety regulations, such as social distancing and mandatory masks<ref>{{Cite web|title=Voting & COVID-19 - Vote.org|url=https://vote.org/covid-19|access-date=2020-10-07|website=vote.org|language=en-US}}</ref>.
