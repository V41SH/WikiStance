      "===Refusal to prosecute Ed Buck===",
      "Lacey was heavily criticized for refusing to prosecute [[Ed Buck]], a wealthy [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] donor, following the 2017 drug overdose death of a young Black man named Gemmel Moore in Buck's apartment. At the time, [[Los Angeles County Sheriff]]'s deputies found \"nearly two grams of [[methamphetamine]], syringes and drug paraphernalia throughout the residence\".<ref>{{cite web | title=It took two years to arrest Democratic donor Ed Buck despite shocking allegations, red flags.

      "Six months after Lacey declined to prosecute Ed Buck for Gemmel Moore's death, another Black man, Timothy Dean, was found dead of a drug overdose in Buck's apartment in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web | title=Man Who Died in Democratic Donor Ed Buck's Home Called Him 'The Devil'| url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-who-died-in-democratic-donor-ed-bucks-home-called-him-the-devil |work= The Daily Beast}}</ref> Activists renewed their calls to Lacey to prosecute Buck, but again she declined. In an October 2019 meeting of the Stonewall Democratic Club, a [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] organization in Los Angeles, Lacey claimed that Sheriff's deputies' illegal search and seizure of evidence in Buck's residence at the time of Moore's death rendered the evidence inadmissible in court, and therefore \"presented a challenge\" to her efforts to prosecute. She did not respond to participants' criticism that deputies should not have taken legal advice from a coroner, as Lacey claimed they had.<ref>{{cite web | title=D.A.
