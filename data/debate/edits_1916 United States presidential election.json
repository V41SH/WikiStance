      "The 1916 Republican National Convention was held in [[Chicago]] between June 7 and 10.",
      "",
      "A major goal of the party bosses at the convention was to heal the bitter split within the party that had occurred in the 1912 presidential campaign. Although several candidates were openly competing for the 1916 nomination — most prominently Senator [[Elihu Root]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and Senator [[John W. Weeks]] of [[Massachusetts]] — the party's bosses wanted a moderate who would be acceptable to both factions of the party.",
      "",
      "They turned to Supreme Court Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]], who had been serving on the court since 1910 and had the advantage of not having publicly spoken about political issues in six years. Although he had not actively sought the nomination, Hughes made it known that he would not turn it down. He won the nomination on the third ballot. Former Vice President [[Charles W. Fairbanks]] was nominated as his running mate. As of {{Currentyear}} Hughes remains the only active Supreme Court Justice to be nominated for president by a major political party.",
