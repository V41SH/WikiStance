      "An ethics watchdog group requested that Congress investigate Democratic Rep. Susie Lee after accusing her of a conflict of interest in asking the Small Business Administration (SBA) to expand its coronavirus loan eligibility in a way that they say benefited her husband's business.",
      "",
      "Just weeks after Lee's reported request, SBA changed its criteria on April 28 to include the gaming industry. Two weeks later, Full House Resorts, of which both Lee and her husband own millions of dollars in stock and options, received a total of $5.6 million in loans -- a conflict of interest, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust argued in a complaint that was filed.",
      "",
      "\"A conflict of interest exists,\" the FACT complaint reads, \"when a Member's private affairs appear to, or actually do, conflict with their ability to officially act on behalf of the public interest ... Because the integrity of government action is at risk, the ethics rules require Members to refrain from official action where there is even an inference of a conflict, as well as where there is an actual conflict.‚Äù <ref> https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fact-susie-lee-complaint-casinos </ref>",
