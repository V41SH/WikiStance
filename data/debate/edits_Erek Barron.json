State of Delaware,'' in which McCoy was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal before the Delaware Supreme Court, the Court decided, unanimously, to reverse McCoy's convictions and death sentence based on prosecutorial misconduct and voir dire error.<ref>{{cite web |title=Isaiah W.
