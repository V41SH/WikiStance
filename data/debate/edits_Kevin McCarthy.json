      "By failing to hold President Trump responsible for the January 6th insurrection and continually trying to undermine Congress's investigation into the events surrounding January 6th, McCarthy has made clear that he supports domestic terrorism in the United States. While traditionally, Republicans have run on soundbites such as being the party of \"Law and Order\", this notion is now something of the past. Senator McCarthy's actions following January 6th show that he has no interest in enforcing the rule of law when it comes to domestic terrorism."
