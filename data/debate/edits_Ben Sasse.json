      "As of now, Ben Sasse represents what Lani Guiner describes as \"The Tyranny of the Majority.\"  He and Sen. Deb Fisher represent 100% of the Nebraska's voice by the vote of only 347,636 Nebraskans, out of the 1.8 million people who lived here in 2014 when he was elected.  The 1,352,364 people who did not vote for Ben Sasse do not get a voice in the United States senate.  Those 1.3 million people are silenced by Ben Sasse, as his staffers do not act respectfully towards constituents who contact his office with concerns.  Senator Sasse does not consider the political preferences of the Nebraskans who are not those 347,636 voters.  If you question the validity of this claim, please call him at his office on the Hill 202-224-4224 and present him with an idea he does not currently advocate for."
