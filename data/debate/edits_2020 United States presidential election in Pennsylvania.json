      "On October 22, 2020, Democrat candidate Joe Biden turned in a dreadful debate performance that damaged his flailing campaign irrecoverably. In this debate, Biden admitted that he wanted to “transition from the oil industry” and abolish fossil fuels. This radical left-wing position would have killed the jobs of millions of hard-working Americans and decimated the nation’s economy. Biden’s comment was perhaps the perhaps the most shocking statement ever made during a debate, and it received widespread backlash. The people of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Texas, and other states were appalled by Biden’s plan to abolish energy and destroy their livelihoods. It was especially offensive to voters in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, where Biden’s plan to ban fracking proved incredibly unpopular. This gaffe, along with the rest of Biden’s disastrous performance in the final debate, proved to be the difference maker in the election. The American people wanted a leader who would stand up for their jobs and protect American energy. As a result, President Donald Trump won these states and more as part of his landslide re-election victory in November."

      "Pennsylvania was one of the many states that the Democrats attempted to RIG with massive mail-in ballot fraud in 2020. The election was a complete disaster, as unsolicited mail-in ballots could not be counted on November 3 and the state refused to declare President Trump as its rightful winner. As a result, Pennsylvania Republicans and the court system stepped in and put a stop to the illegal mail-in scam, ending the charade of “counting” unsolicited fraudulent Democrat ballots indefinitely. Even when Democrat lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s Great Supreme Court Justices prevented a RIGGED ELECTION and declared him the rightful winner based on legally cast votes."

      "Pennsylvania was one of the many states that the Democrats attempted to RIG with massive mail-in ballot fraud in 2020. The election was a complete disaster, as unsolicited mail-in ballots could not be counted on November 3 and the state refused to declare President Trump as its rightful winner. As a result, Pennsylvania Republicans and the court system stepped in and put a stop to the illegal mail-in scam, ending the charade of “counting” unsolicited fraudulent Democrat ballots indefinitely. Even when Democrat lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s Great Supreme Court Justices prevented a RIGGED ELECTION and declared him the rightful winner based on legally cast votes."
