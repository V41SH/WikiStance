      "Before Nixon had become president, the United States had a good relationship with both India and Pakistan at various times.

The Soviets had stated that they would [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] any criticism of [[United Nations]] regarding its intervention in the war. Nixon favored Pakistan over India especially after its [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Yahya Khan]] helped in organizing a summit with China.

He wanted to make sure that Pakistan wasn't split into two and sympathized with Yahya Khan, stating it was difficult for anyone to rule over Bangladesh. Though Nixon and Kissinger knew of [[Pakistan Army]]'s brutality on Bengalis, both would mock [[Archer Blood]] for complaining about its genocidal actions there and didn't want to upset Pakistan's government by criticizing its actions openly. Nixon stated that it was better for them to stay out of it just like in the [[Nigerian Civil War]], stating, \"I don't like it, but I didn't like shooting [[Biafrans]] either.\"<ref>https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Blood_Telegram/yjJjDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=I+don%27t+like+it,+but+I+didn%27t+like+shooting+Biafrans+either&pg=PP83&printsec=frontcover</ref>",
