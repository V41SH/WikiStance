      "Mottley addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York  on 24 September 2021 with a short speech to support [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ant√≥nio Guterres]]' warnings that the world is moving in the wrong direction. She threw away her original script and instead gave a passionate post in which she called for global, moral leadership in the fight against climate change, economic and technological inequality, racism and unfair distribution of coronary vaccines."
