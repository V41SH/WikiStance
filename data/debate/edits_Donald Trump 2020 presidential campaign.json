      "The Trump campaign ran video and pictorial advertisements on Facebook, YouTube, and Google, which falsely claimed that Joe Biden used a teleprompter during a April 2020 interview with James Corden. A teleprompter was seen on Biden's screen during that interview, but that was in fact Corden's teleprompter, not Biden's. The teleprompter was shared on the screens of Corden's interviewees via Zoom. The Trump campaign used the advertisement to claim that Biden \"can't handle an interview\", \"can't handle presidency\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dale |first1=Daniel |last2=O'Sullivan |first2=Donie |title=Fact check: Trump campaign runs ads falsely accusing Biden of using teleprompter on James Corden's show |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/24/politics/fact-check-biden-teleprompter-corden/index.html |accessdate=October 4, 2020 |work=[[CNN]] |date=September 25, 2020}}</ref>"
