      "As part of the [[2020 United States Senate elections]], Georgia held run-off elections for both of its [[United States Senate|Senate]] seats on January 5, 2021. The run-off elections were triggered because of a Georgia law requiring a second round when no individual wins a majority of the vote in most federal, state, and local elections.{{efn|Georgia's run-off law applies to all races except for presidential elections.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Kate |last2=Levy |first2=Adam |title=These states have unique election rules |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/03/politics/unique-voting-laws-by-state/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=November 3, 2020}}</ref>}} Democrats [[Jon Ossoff]] and [[Raphael Warnock]] were the victors in those special elections, which gave the Democrats a total of 48 seats to the Republicans' 50. However, the victories resulted in a shift of power to the Democrats; the other two Senators, [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont and [[Angus King]] of Maine, are both [[Independent politician|independents]] who belong to the Democrats' [[caucus]], and since any tied vote is broken by the [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]] &mdash; in this case Vice President [[Kamala Harris]], also a Democrat &mdash; the Democrats technically hold a one-seat majority.",

      "The 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was won by Glenn Youngkin in an enormous upset. For months, the liberal mainstream media had said the Virginia would never vote for a Republican and that Creepy Clintonite Terry McAuliffe would win in a rout, but they had no idea how much BACKLASH and OUTRAGE the Democrat party had stirred. All over the great Commonwealth, people were fed up with the far-left agenda of Joe Biden, the most unpopular and hated president in American history. While Joe and Terry were pushing Critical Race Theory, Virginians realized that Democrat socialist policies had wrecked the economy, skyrocketed inflation, and created shortages of anything and everything. Then, in an act of total desperation, Terry and his campaign disgracefully tried to slander Glenn Youngkin as a Neo-Nazi. The people of Virginia were not fooled by these lies, however, and Glenn won BIG, proving that a massive RED WAVE had begun for Republicans across the country!"
