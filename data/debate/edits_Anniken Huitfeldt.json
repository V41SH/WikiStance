      "Huitfeldt advised that the EEA committee would be discussing the [[European Union]]’s railway policy on 29 October, and added: “The meeting of the EEA Committee on 29 October is the first since the change of government. I can confirm that Norway's representative will make the EU side aware of the government platform at this meeting. We will inform our EEA / EFTA partners of this in advance.” She went on to add: “we are particularly skeptical about the requirements concerning the tendering of passenger train traffic. We believe that tenders are not the right tool to offer travelers a good railway offer. There should be great national freedom to opt out of this”. She further said that contracts could still be given directly before the transition expires on 25 December 2023, and last up to ten years.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/47W17G/regjeringen-bekrefter-starter-kampen-mot-eus-nye-jernbanepolitikk | title= Regjeringen bekrefter: Starter kampen mot EUs nye jernbanepolitikk | publisher = [[Verdens Gang|VG]] | date= 26 October 2021 | accessdate = 26 October 2021 | language = Norwegian}}</ref>"
