      "Another strange controversy resulted from CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]] commenting that the two candidates had not shaken hands after the debate. This was compounded seconds later, while the candidates were greeting the audience, as McCain tapped Obama on the back, but instead of extending his own hand to Obama presented his wife.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI0iIOqPGak</ref>. The idea of McCain having 'snubbed' Obama took hold. However, those paying attention would have noticed that the two candidates had in fact both shaken hands and hugged during Tom Brokaw's final remarks."
